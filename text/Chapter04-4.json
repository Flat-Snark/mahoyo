		"　翌日。空は相変わらずの曇り模様。",
		"　一日の授業は何事もなく終わった。",
		"　冬休み前の期末試験まであとわずか。",
		"　今では厳しい規律に支配された<三咲高|ミサコー>であるが、もともとは生徒の自主性を第一とするおおらかな私立高校である。",
		"　真面目な生徒は生徒会長の<庇|ひ><護|ご>の下とことん真面目に。",
		"　気楽な生徒は、まあ個人の責任のかぎり、とことん自由に放課後を過ごしているのだった。",
		"　そして、その自由な生徒の代表みたいな男が生徒会の副会長にいるあたり、この学校の懐の深さはちょっとおかしい。",
		"「蒼崎、いるかー！」",
		"　おもに密会用と噂される第二生徒会室の扉を、<槻司|つきじ><鳶丸|とびまる>は陽気にブチ開けた。",
		"　これでも副会長さまであり、生徒会の<陰|かげ>の雑務係と哀れまれる人物である。",
		"　狭苦しい室内には待ち人がひとり。",
		"　生徒会長・蒼崎青子は姿勢良くパイプ椅子に座って、大声を上げた鳶丸をじろりと睨んでいる。",
		"「あいかわらず寒いなこの部屋。",
		"　なあ、今度ストーブ購入しようぜ」",
		"　青子の無言の圧迫に負けないように、鳶丸は何気なく会話を切り出した。",
		"「お疲れさま。ところでアンタ、何しに来たのか分かってる？」",
		"「まあな。ただ、事務的に話すのって寒いじゃねえか。",
		"　少しぐらい世間話でもしねえとつまらねえだろ？」",
		"　鳶丸は扉を閉めて、青子の前の椅子に座った。",
		"　その手には青い封筒を抱えている。",
		"「こういう時は無駄口はたたかない方がいいわよ。",
		"　なんとなくプロっぽいでしょ」",
		"「なる―――いや、いやいやいや」",
		"　青子の刺々しい返答にそうかも、と同意しかけて、鳶丸はイヤイヤと首を振った。",
		"　いくらフリーダムな鳶丸でも、そんな諜報員めいた日常は<御免|ごめん><蒙|こうむ>る。",
		"「それで、調べ終わったの？」",
		"「ああ。ついさっき最後の聴取を済ませてきた。",
		"　詳しい事はその封筒に入ってる。おまえから渡された例のファイルも、そん中」",
		"　ぱさり、と机に置かれる青封筒。",
		"「そう」",
		"　青子は封筒を手にし、中の書類に目を通す。",
		"　そこからは完全に彼女ひとりの世界で、鳶丸に対して気を配ってさえいない。",
		"　歯に<衣|きぬ>着せずに言えば、パーフェクトなまでの無視っぷりである。",
		"「………………なあ」",
		"「なに？」",
		"「ひとつ、聞きたいんだけどよ」",
		"「だから、なに？」",
		"　冷えきった沈黙。",
		"　無感情に書類をチェックする青子と、",
		"　そんな青子をどうでもよさげに、しかし正面から見据える鳶丸。",
		"「蒼崎、そういうの作って楽しい？」",
		"「楽しいワケないでしょ。こんなの、作ったところであんまり使う機会なんてないんだから」",
		"「そうか。ならいい」",
		"　納得いったのか、<憮然|ぶぜん>顔のまま鳶丸は席を立った。",
		"「最後まで読めば分かるだろうが、あんまり確証は取れなかったぜ。",
		"というより、一昨日あの辺りにいた生徒はいないって話になりそうだ。ま、断定はできないけどな」",
		"　鳶丸はつれない態度でドアに向かう。",
		"　俺はこの件には無関係です、と言わんばかりだ。",
		"「―――っと、そうだ。",
		"　そういえば一人だけ該当しなかった奴がいる。季節外れの転入生までは、蒼崎も調べきれなかったみてえじゃねぇか」",
		"　わずかに顔をあげる青子。",
		"　たしかに転入したばかりの生徒は彼女の調査範囲に含まれてはいない。",
		"「そんなわけで草の字に関しては調べてないぜ。",
		"　ま、アイツならいつだろうと遅くまでバイトだろうが……いや、人殺しを見た、なんてコト口走ってるようじゃ、家で悪い夢でも見てたのかもしれねえか」",
		"　鳶丸は陽気にこぼして去っていった。",
		"「―――、は？」",
		"　同時に、青子は持っていた書類を机に落とした。",
		"　別にそんなつもりはなかったのに、なぜか、指先から力が失われてしまったらしい。",
		"「……そんな、まさかね」",
		"　考えすぎだ、と自分に対して軽口を言ってみる。",
		"　けれど突然生まれた不安は消えず、こういう時の自分の直感がたいてい合っている事を、蒼崎青子は知っていた。",
		"「―――馬鹿らしい」",
		"　だとしてもやる事は同じだ。",
		"　仮に目撃者が鳶丸だった場合、青子は<躊躇|ためら>わず殺せるだろう。",
		"　けれど、それが彼だったら？",
		"　そんな『もしも』を連想した途端、どんな仮定より冷めきっていく自分を感じた。",
		"　青子は額に手を当てて考えこむ。",
		"　そうして唐突に、",
		"「選択の話をしよう。おまえは常に二者択一を迫られる。",
		"　善良な愚者と醜悪な賢者。すべてを救う手段はない。どちらかを選ぶこと。それだけが、おまえに許された自由となる」",
		"　二年前。",
		"　姉に代わって後継ぎになった日に祖父から贈られた言葉を呟いて、青子は小さく嘆息した。",
		"「―――すごく、バカみたい」",
		"　自分の勘の良さに<嗤|わら>ってしまう。",
		"　本当。",
		"そんな台詞、口にしなければよかったのにと。",
		"　青子は戸締まりを済ませ、生徒会室を後にした。",
		"　平然と、それこそ何もなかったようにすれ違う生徒たちと挨拶を交わせるあたり、自分らしいと呆れながら。",
		"　学校にはまだ活気がある。",
		"　部活動の生徒は言うに及ばず、用を済ませて下校していく生徒たちの話し声で校庭は騒がしい。",
		"　今にも泣きだしそうな灰色の空だが、彼らにはさして気になる問題ではないようだ。",
		"　そんな喧噪にまじって、青子は早足で校門に向かう。",
		"　お<喋|しゃべ>りに花を咲かす生徒たちを通りすぎる。",
		"　会話の内容は放課後の予定について。",
		"いかに無駄なく充実した放課後を過ごすかを真剣に論じている。",
		"　彼らが持つ、<遮二無二|しゃにむに>に遊ぼうという気は知れないけど、馬鹿にする気も、羨ましがる気持ちも青子にはない。",
		"　ほんの二年前まで、そういった自由を心から愛していた自分がいたとしてもだ。",
		"『……根は冷めてるのかな、私って』",
		"　マフラーをきつめに締めてみたが、それで孤独を漂わせるにはまだ経験が少なかった。",
		"　そもそも淋しいと思わない人間が孤独を装っても、それは孤独ではなく拒絶と言うのだ。",
		"『……そうよね。孤独っていうのはああいうのを言うもんでしょうし』",
		"　校門はいつもより騒がしい。",
		"　原因は校門の陰で立往生をしている男子生徒たちだ。",
		"　寄り添って密談をしている彼らは、校門の陰に隠れて、表通りに立っている一人の少女について、ざわざわと論じあっていた。",
		"　少女は黒いケープに身を包んでいた。",
		"　一見すると普段着だが、三咲町の人間なら、ケープ下の服がとある名門女子校の制服である事を知っている。",
		"　もっとも、その女学院は三咲高校とは縁もゆかりもない、距離的にも精神的にも遠く離れた存在である。",
		"　彼女達の大半は寮生活を強いられており、町中で見かける事は滅多にない。",
		"　お嬢様学園と名こそ響いているが、実際にはそうお目にかかれない礼園女学院の制服だ。",
		"　それだけで男どもが騒ぎ立てるには十分だが、くわえて、その少女は上等すぎた。",
		"　可憐としか言いようのない立ち姿。",
		"　身じろぎひとつせず待ち続ける様は、丁寧に描かれた絵画を思わせる。",
		"　その姿を見て、一言で青子が『孤独』と断言したように。",
		"『……まったく、うちの男子どもは。家に帰りもせず、陰でこそこそやってるのはそういうコト』",
		"　呆れながら、青子はずかずかと校門を通過した。",
		"　いつもなら坂道を下りていくところを、まっすぐアスファルトを横断し、道端に立ち続ける少女へと向かう。",
		"「げぇー!?　あれなるは生徒会長さまー!?」",
		"「くそ、追っ払う気なのかよぅ。居たいんならいつまでだって居させてあげればいいじゃんかー！」",
		"「ってか怒られる？　怒られるのあの天使？」",
		"「<他校|よそ>の生徒でも、校門前にいるぐらいなら……別に問題はないと思う……けど……」",
		"「青子女史は容赦ねえからな。下手すると平手だぜ、平手」",
		"「…………はあ」",
		"　背中では言いたい放題だ。",
		"　振り返って黙らせる気分でもなく、青子は少女の目前まで歩いて、やあ、とばかりに片手を上げた。",
		"「どうしたの有珠？　こんなところに来たって、何も面白いコトはないって言ったのに」",
		"「ちょ、ありえねーーーーーーー！！！！？」",
		"　校門の陰から悲鳴らしきものがハモって聞こえたが、もちろん無視する青子だった。",
		"「あの事を確かめに。―――",
		"青子。",
		"　あの人たち、邪魔なんだけど」",
		"「分かってる、いま追っ払うから」",
		"　細い有珠の声に対して、青子ははっきりと、これみよがしに声を大きくしている。",
		"　無論、校門の陰に群がる<十把一絡|じっぱひとから>げに聞こえるように。",
		"「げ、会長こっち来んぞ!?」",
		"「おい、押すなよ、うしろのヤツどけって！　オレ校舎に逃げるから！」",
		"「いや、でも……あの<娘|こ>、会長と知り合いなんでしょ？　うまく会長に紹介してもらう、とか……」",
		"「あはは、さすが一年坊主。まだ戦場の現実ってもんを理解していねぇ。―――よし、死の<間際|まぎわ>までいい夢見ろよ」",
		"　一ヶ所に集まりすぎたのか、混乱きわまって校門の陰でつまる男子生徒たち。",
		"そんな彼らを、",
		"「さーて。部活動があるワケでもなし、ただ家に帰るだけの帰宅部の皆さん？　こんなところで何を集まってるのか、教えてくれる？」",
		"「ひぃぃいい！」",
		"　どーん、と擬音を背負って<睥睨|へいげい>する生徒会長。",
		"「なにしろ試験前だもの。",
		"　<実|み>になる事なら私も教えてほしいけど、まさか<雁首|がんくび>並べて女学院のお嬢様を<眺|なが>めてただけ、なんて事はないわよね？",
		"　声をかける勇気もなくて、眺めてただけ、なんて事は」",
		"　はい、実はそうなんです、などと返答できる剛の者はいなかった。それだけの勇気があるならとっくに声をかけている。",
		"「……いや、ボク教室にちょっと忘れ物が……」",
		"「こんなオチならダメもとで玉砕しとくんだった……」",
		"「天文部にいって双眼鏡借りるのどうだ？　屋上からお顔を<賜|たまわ>るとか」",
		"「天文部にそんなのねえよ！　あるとしたら野鳥同好会じゃね？」",
		"「あはははは。それ、先月会長が潰したじゃん。<鳥|とり><愛|め>でてる暇があるなら彼女作れって」",
		"「あはは、は……彼女、作れです、か……すみませんっす、今日は裏口から帰るっす、ザキさん……」",
		"「クソ、じゃあなー会長ー！　また明日ー！」",
		"　愛らしい捨て台詞を残し、負け犬のようにハラハラと散っていく男子生徒たち。",
		"「楽しそうね、青子」",
		"「あ、わかる？」",
		"　有珠の一言に、つい即答する青子。",
		"　事実、三咲高校の生徒たちは嫌味のない人間ばかりで、彼らとのやりとりは愉快ではあるのだ。",
		"「―――で。",
		"　ここまで出向くって事は、何か分かったの？」",
		"「結界に残っていた気配の識別は。あとはここで確かめればいいだけよ」",
		"「そう。ん……？　有珠、いつからここに？」",
		"「下校時刻から」",
		"　……という事はかれこれ一時間は経つ。",
		"　寒がりな彼女にとって、同じ場所に一時間も立つのは辛かっただろう。",
		"「悪いわね、無理させて」",
		"「……別に。好きでやってる事だから」",
		"　言いながらも、彼女の黒い瞳は校門を通る生徒たちを見つめている。",
		"　こうやって一時間ものあいだ、有珠は校門を監視していたのだろう。",
		"「私を待ってたワケじゃないんでしょ？　今からでも付き合うわ」",
		"　こくん、と頷く有珠。",
		"　有珠が残っているのは、いまだ目撃者を発見できていないからだ。",
		"　結界に残った気配に一致する生徒がいたのなら、有珠は青子を待たずに帰宅し、その生徒の素性を調べていただろう。",
		"「私の方はダメだった」",
		"　鳶丸に調べさせた結果について、青子は結果だけを告げた。有珠に言葉はない。",
		"　会話はそれで打ち止めになり、あとは冷たい風に耐えるだけである。",
		"　……無言の監視はあてもなく続く。",
		"　校門に来た生徒たちは、生徒会長と礼園女学院の生徒という組み合わせに驚きつつ下校していく。",
		"　退屈さと冬の寒さも手伝ってか、二十分もすぎると青子はため息をついていた。",
		"「ね、有珠。帰り、<黎明|レイメイ>に寄ってかない？」",
		"　ちらり、と有珠の顔を覗きこむ青子。",
		"　黎明は青子お気に入りの喫茶店の名前である。",
		"「……………………」",
		"　状況を理解していない青子への非難か、それともわりと同意なのか、有珠は微かに視線を動かした。",
		"　その視線の先には―――",
		"「あれ、蒼崎も待ち合わせか？」",
		"　意識の隙を<衝|つ>くような、突然の声。",
		"　自然な、刺のない口調が誰であるかは言うまでもない。",
		"「―――そ。やっぱ、そうなるワケか」",
		"　有珠に背中を向けて、青子はキッと、やってきた生徒を見据える。",
		"「それで、今日は何の用？」",
		"　こんにちはも何もない。",
		"　不機嫌な青子の視線は、その険悪さをより増して草十郎に向けられる。",
		"　が、そんな青子の眼力も草十郎には通じなかったようだ。",
		"「いや、これから駅前で水泳部の部長と待ち合わせなんだけど、その事でお礼を言っておきたくて」",
		"「？」",
		"　それは、意外と言えば意外な一言だった筈だ。",
		"　部活とお礼。",
		"　……ただ、その組み合わせなら、この人物は間の抜けた事を言ってくるだろうと、青子は思ってもいた。なんの根拠もなかったけれど。",
		"「……ふうん。お礼って、お礼参りってこと？」",
		"「？」",
		"　これまた幸運な事に、学生におけるお礼参りの意味も、草十郎はまだ知らずにいたらしい。",
		"「よく分からないけど、そんな大した事じゃないよ。",
		"　ただ、水泳部は夏までそう忙しくないって話だったから」",
		"　そういう部活を<薦|すす>めてくれたんだな、と草十郎は続けようとしたが、青子はつまらなそうな顔で遮った。",
		"「当然でしょう。幽霊部員になりそうな生徒なんて、紹介できないから。忙しい貴方でも<勤|つと>まりそうな場所があったから、口に出しただけよ」",
		"「なるほど、無駄がないね」",
		"　感心する草十郎に、青子は文句を言う気も無くしてしまった。",
		"　彼女にとって、彼に似合った部活を探して部長に話をつけること自体が無駄な事だったのだが。",
		"「とにかく、お世話になったから。",
		"　それで礼を言っときたくて」",
		"　ありがとう、と今にも頭を下げそうな草十郎を、あわてて青子は止める。",
		"「よしてよ。いま貴方にそんな事されても迷惑だから。",
		"　……",
		"それで、水泳部はどう？　やっていけそう？」",
		"　鋭かった視線が、どこか気まずいものに変わる。",
		"　青子の態度に違和感を覚える草十郎だったが、その理由までは分からない。",
		"　なので、とりあえず分かるところから、と最新のニュースを青子に告げた。",
		"「ああ、水泳部はクビになった」",
		"「な、",
		"なんでよーーー！？」",
		"　予想外の返答に、思わず怒鳴る青子。",
		"　……びっくり箱の化身にも程がある。",
		"　あまりの展開に、青子の複雑にねじれていた心持ちが一瞬で真っ白になるぐらい。",
		"「だだ、だって、今から待ち合わせだって……！」",
		"「それは、これから<社木|やしろぎ>の温水プールに連れていってくれるからだよ」",
		"　驚く青子に、うん、と告げる草十郎。",
		"「……話が繋がらない。そこまで上手くいってるのに、どうして入部を拒否されるのよ、アンタは！」",
		"「そりゃあ、俺が泳げないからだろ」",
		"「――――――」",
		"　なるほど、そうきたか、と眉間を指で押さえる青子。",
		"「……静希君。昨日の私の質問は覚えてる？　走るのか泳ぐのか、どっちがいいかってヤツ。",
		"　私の記憶は正しいけど、いちおう確認しておくわね。",
		"　貴方、たしかに泳ぐ方だって言ったけど……？」",
		"「ああ。昔から、泳げないのはなんとか克服したかったんだ。反対に、走る方は得意だけど」",
		"　あっそ、と答えて青子は力尽きた。",
		"「俺が一年なら一から鍛えてくれたらしいんだけど。",
		"　あと三ヶ月で三年になる身分なのに、カナヅチの部員は雇えないそうだ。",
		"　けど部長が親身になってくれて、これから泳ぎを教えてくれる事になったんだよ」",
		"　どこか嬉しそうに言う草十郎の言葉は、青子にはあまり届いていない。",
		"『はあ……つまり、欠陥品を売り付けたってワケか……こりゃ水泳部の部長に合わす顔がない……っと、",
		"ちょっと待った』",
		"「静希君。水泳部の部長って……」",
		"　女子、と言いかけて止めた。",
		"　口にした途端、自分が変なことを口走りそうで怖くなったからだ。",
		"「……もういいわ。気持ちは分かったから、どこか遠くにいてくれない？　少し疲れてて、とてもじゃないけど貴方の相手はしていられないの」",
		"「鳶丸もそんな事を言ってたな。蒼崎は昨日と今日、めずらしく疲れてるって。何かあったのか？」",
		"「ちょっとね。でもいいの。解決したみたいだから。",
		"　それより……静希君はどう見える？　私、そんなに疲れて見えるのかな」",
		"　何故そんな事を訊ねたのか。",
		"　青子にしては珍しい、",
		"　理由のない、<惰性|だせい>で口から出た言葉だ。",
		"　……あえて言うなら、これが最後だろうから、何かしらか普通の会話をしておこうと思ったのかもしれない。",
		"　草十郎はしばし考えこんでから、そのぼんやりした雰囲気からかけ離れた笑顔を浮かべた。",
		"「そうだな、疲れているというより生き生きしているように見える。仕方なく畑をたがやしていた狼が、久しぶりに狩りにでる事になって<気炎|きえん>をあげている感じだ」",
		"　めでたいな、と。",
		"　まるで我が事のように、彼は微笑んだ。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　知れず、青子は頬に手を当てた。",
		"　彼の言う事が本当なら、今の自分はこの上なく味のあるニヤけ顔をしている事になる。",
		"　当然、そんなヘマは犯していなかったが。",
		"「とにかくありがとう。じゃあ、また明日」",
		"　まだ手を上げるほどの気楽さはないのか、草十郎は真摯な声と<表情|かお>だけで挨拶をして去ろうとする。",
		"「待って。こんな話があるの。聞いてから行って」",
		"　そんな草十郎を青子は呼び止めた。",
		"　温和になりかけていた自分を<戒|いまし>める、冷たい声で。",
		"「うん？」",
		"「意味のない<喩|たと>え話よ。",
		"　……そうね。貴方が空腹で死にそうな時、目の前に、同じように空腹で死にそうな二匹の動物がいるとするわ。",
		"　静希君に銃をあげる。それでどちらかの動物を撃って。",
		"　右はライオンで左は子猫。選ぶのは貴方の自由だから」",
		"　どことなく童話めいた質問。",
		"　残酷さと教訓と、押しつけがましいところがとくに。",
		"　この手の話は考えこむときりがない。",
		"　が、彼はあっさりと返答した。",
		"「いや、撃たないと思うよ。だって、自分の好きにしていいんだろう？　それにほら、空腹ならお互い様だ」",
		"　おそらくは悩む間もなかっただろう。",
		"　それは本当にどうかと思うぐらい、真っ白な解答だった。",
		"「……長生きするわ、貴方」",
		"「すごい台詞だな。そんなコトを言われたのは、たぶん君が初めてだ」",
		"　笑顔には似つかわしくない台詞。",
		"「――――――なによ、それ」",
		"　……呼び止めるべきではなかったと後悔する。",
		"　あのまま見送っていれば、こんな答えを聞くこともなかったのに、と。",
		"　そして、静希草十郎はてくてくと坂道を下っていった。",
		"　今日も今日とて、夜遅くまでアルバイトでもあるのだろう。",
		"　残されたのは青子と、今まで背景と化していた有珠だけである。",
		"「つくづく……こっちのペースを乱してくれるわね、あの人畜無害な田舎者は」",
		"　ぐっと右手を強く握り締めて、青子は独白する。",
		"　どこでもいいから体に力を入れておかないと、ここで意味不明の大声を上げかねなかった。",
		"　……それが相手への罵倒なのか、自分への罵倒なのかは、口にしないと分からない。",
		"「青子」",
		"　後ろから有珠の細い声が聞こえる。彼女が何を言おうとしているかは、ちょっと前から分かっている。",
		"　……今までどんな生徒にも無反応だった彼女が、草十郎の出現で表情を変えた時から。",
		"「言わなくてもいい。あいつでしょ、目撃者は」",
		"　それは冷めきった、",
		"　知らない人間の事を口にする声だった。",
		"　―――ライオンと猫。",
		"　それぞれ長所短所のある、結局のところ、自分とは違う生き物を選べと彼女は言った。",
		"　リスクでいうのならライオンの方が大きい。銃口を向けた瞬間、最後の反撃をする可能性もある。",
		"　だから、ライオンを狙う方が勇気はいるけれど、同時に銃を持つという後ろめたさはなくなっている。",
		"　なにしろ相手は強い生き物だ。人間側の勝手な言い訳であれ、銃を使うことへの罪悪感は薄れてくれる。",
		"　では、猫はどうだろう。弱い生き物。",
		"　言うまでもなくライオンを狙うより簡単だ。けれど、誰だって不快な気持ちになる。",
		"　初めから対等でないとしても、その理不尽さはあまりにも度が過ぎている。",
		"　青子にとって、草十郎はその“理不尽さ”に該当するものだった。",
		"『……てっきり、私もそうだと思ってた……』",
		"　生徒会室でもしもと危惧した時は、そうであっても仕方がない、と思いきった。",
		"けれど去りぎわの草十郎の言葉で、その決心が揺らいでいる。",
		"　この胸の不快さは、後ろめたさだけの<躊躇|とまど>いではない。",
		"　静希草十郎は気に入らない人間であり、弱い相手であり、誰よりも御しやすい相手だ。",
		"　なのになぜ、自分は躊躇いを覚えるのか。",
		"　田舎から上京してきて身寄りもない転入生。",
		"　他のまっとうな人間と違って、ここで消えたところで騒ぎだす人間も少ない。",
		"　殺すなら、それこそ猫の首をひねるように仕留められる。",
		"　……ほんと、いい事ずくめで頭にくる。",
		"　なんて<幸運|ラッキー>。その尻をつま先で蹴り飛ばしてムチャクチャにしたいぐらい、正直、余計なお世話と苛々する―――",
		"「……信じられない。私、嫌がってる。これは違う。",
		"　―――こんなの、私じゃない」",
		"　呟きは背後の有珠にも聞こえていたかも知れない。",
		"　しかし、有珠は相棒の<癇癪|かんしゃく>など気にもせず、",
		"「彼、首に布を巻いていたわね」",
		"　などと、まったく関係のない感想を口にした。",
		"　有珠の言葉に青子はハッと我に返る。",
		"「くび……？」",
		"「……ええ。水泳部のクビとかけていたのかしら」",
		"　ほとんど独り言の、心底から考えている有珠だった。",
		"「そういえば……あいつ、初めて会った時も首に布巻いてたっけ。<衿|えり>を行儀よく締めてるから目立たないけど」",
		"　重要性のない、意味のない会話。",
		"　何ら解決を生むものではなかったけれど、ぐらぐらと揺れていた青子の思考は、それできっかり落ち着いてくれた。",
		"「……サンキュ、落ち着いたわ有珠。",
		"　それと気合いも入った。",
		"　善は急げ、あいつが言い触らす前に決着をつけよう」",
		"　よし、とばかりに青子は校門に背を向ける。",
		"　とりあえず、洋館に戻って戦闘準備をしなくてはならない。",
		"「……いいけど、いつ、どこで彼を殺すの？」",
		"　……小さい声だが公衆の面前で口にする言葉ではない。",
		"　有珠のこういった物騒さをたしなめるのは青子の役割だが、物騒さで言えば今の彼女も大差はないらしい。",
		"「今日の夜。場所はとっておきの夢の国よ」",
		"　有珠を<咎|とが>めもせず、クスリと不敵な笑みを浮かべる青子。",
		"　それは恋人と待ち合わせる時のような、不思議と<爽|さわ>やかな響きだった。"

		"  The following day was a typically overcast one.",
		"  The day's classes ended as they had started: uneventfully.",
		"  Winter break was just around the corner, and with it final exams.",
		"  Although Misaki High prided itself on discipline, it was still a private school, and as such promoted a culture of independence among its students.",
		"  Industrious students had a place to explore that side of themselves under the guardianship of the student council president.",
		"  More easygoing students could spend their time after school as they wished, as long as they were mindful of personal responsibility.",
		"  The fact that the poster boy of independence was the student council vice-president indicated just how vast the spectrum was.",
		"\"Yoohoo, Aozakiii!\"",
		"  Tobimaru Tsukiji threw open the door to the satellite student council room, the rumored location for their secret meetings.",
		"  Despite all appearances, he was the student council vice-president, who also happened to be the poor soul responsible for executing the student council's dirty work.",
		"  One person was waiting for him in the cramped room.",
		"  The student council president, Aoko Aozaki, sat imperiously in a folding chair, glaring at Tobimaru and his boisterous entrance.",
		"\"This room is freezing, as usual.",
		"  We really need to buy a heater.\"",
		"  So as not to succumb to Aoko's oppressive silence, Tobimaru opened with some casual small talk.",
		"\"Thank you for coming. Let's get down to business. Do you know why I've asked you here?\"",
		"\"I have an idea. What's up with the formality, Aozaki?",
		"  Pretty harsh to talk shop right away all the time, you know?\"",
		"  Tobimaru closed the door and sat down across from Aoko.",
		"  He was holding a blue envelope.",
		"\"Yeah, and loose lips sink ships.",
		"  Might remember that once you get out into the real world.\"",
		"\"All right, I'll remem―Wait a sec. Nice try.\"",
		"  Tobimaru was halfway to agreeing with Aoko before he caught himself and began to shake his head.",
		"  As much as Tobimaru enjoyed the lack of red tape in his new line of work, he was not ready to turn full spy on his first day on the job.",
		"\"So then. Are you done with your investigation?\"",
		"\"Yeah. I finished the last interview just now.",
		"  The details are in the envelope along with the file you gave me.\"",
		"  He tossed the envelope onto the table.",
		"\"Good.\"",
		"  Aoko picked it up and began to scan through the documents that were inside.",
		"  She entered her own little world, not sparing the slightest bit of attention for Tobimaru.",
		"  If ignoring other people were a skill, she would be a master at it.",
		"\"...Ahem.\"",
		"\"What?\"",
		"\"I just wanted to ask one thing.\"",
		"\"Yeah, and?\"",
		"  The room was filled with a chilling silence.",
		"  Aoko continued reading without an ounce of emotion upon her face.",
		"  Though Tobimaru kept up an air of indifference, his stare remained fixed intently on her.",
		"\"Do you get a kick out of doing this kind of thing, Aozaki?\"",
		"\"Of course not. What's so fun about gathering intel I hardly even get to use?\"",
		"\"Riiight. Just wanted to check.\"",
		"  Whether or not he was convinced, Tobimaru stood up from his chair with a disappointed expression.",
		"\"You'll figure this out just by reading it all, but I wasn't able to dig up anything conclusive.",
		"By all indications, that there weren't any students in the area the day before yesterday. It's not like I can say that for sure, though.\"",
		"  No longer concerned over his task, Tobimaru headed toward the door,",
		"  as if to say it was out of his hands.",
		"\"...Oh, and one more thing.",
		"  There was one student that wasn't included in your dragnet. You forgot to include any out-of-term transfers.\"",
		"  Aoko raised her head ever so slightly.",
		"  He was right. The recent transfer student was not included within the scope of her investigation.",
		"\"So I haven't looked at Sono-G.",
		"  Though, considering it's him, it's safe to assume that he was working late. Or, wait, it would be if he hadn't have mentioned something about... seeing a murder or whatever. I told him that it was probably just a bad dream.\"",
		"  Tobimaru cheerfully left the student council room.",
		"\"...What?\"",
		"  Simultaneously, Aoko felt her fingers go numb,",
		"  and the documents she was holding spilled all over the table.",
		"\"It can't be. That's not possible...\"",
		"  She broke out into a cold sweat and tried to tell herself that there must be some kind of mistake.",
		"  However, the uncomfortable feeling in her gut would simply not go away. Perhaps because her intuition was almost always right at times like these.",
		"\"...You gotta be kidding me.\"",
		"  And yet, she knew what she had to do.",
		"  She would not have hesitated to kill Tobimaru if he had been the witness.",
		"  But if it was him?",
		"  Just considering the possibility caused her blood to run cold.",
		"  Aoko put her forehead in her hands and began to brood.",
		"  And then, suddenly―",
		"\"Let us talk choice. You will always be faced with choices.",
		"  A virtuous fool and a wicked sage. You cannot save both. You must pick one. That is the freedom granted to you.\"",
		"  Two years earlier.",
		"  Aoko muttered the words offered by her grandfather the day she replaced her elder sister as his successor, and let out a sigh of lament.",
		"\"...This has to be a joke.\"",
		"  She laughed at her own intuition.",
		"  But it was no joke.",
		" If only those words had never been said.",
		"  Aoko locked up the student council room and left for the day.",
		"  Calmly, as though nothing untoward had happened, she greeted the students as they passed her in the halls. She was almost shocked by how natural she seemed.",
		"  There were still plenty of students at the school.",
		"  The grounds were noisy with the chattering of students who had finished the day but had yet to head home. Others still had club activities.",
		"  The gray sky looked ready to pour, but nobody seemed to pay it any mind.",
		"  Amidst the clamor, Aoko hastened to the school gate.",
		"  She passed by some students in animated conversation.",
		"  They seemed to be talking about their after-school plans.",
		"Apparently, they were adamant about maximizing their free time.",
		"  She could not figure how they could possibly be so irresponsibly focused on fun, but at the same time was in no mood to make fun of or feel envious of them.",
		"  Two short years prior, she had been just like them.",
		"(I wonder if I'm becoming desensitized to it all.)",
		"  She re-tied her scarf, this time more tightly, to give off an air of solitude, but she was fooling no one.",
		"  After all, what people who feign solitude are really masking is rejection.",
		"(Solitude, rejection... They're two sides of the same coin.)",
		"  The area by the school gate was busier than usual.",
		"  A group of boys appeared to be huddled behind it.",
		"  Their transparent attempt to be discreet in terms of both location and loudness of voices did nothing to hide the fact that they were noisily arguing about a girl standing alone on the other side of the street.",
		"  The girl was cloaked in a black cape.",
		"  At first glance it could have been mistaken for normal attire, but those from Misaki could tell that she wore the uniform of a prestigious girls' school.",
		"  Said school had no connection to Misaki High in any way, shape, or form. The two schools were far apart both physically and spiritually.",
		"  A member of that school's student body was a rare sighting, as the majority were forced to live in the school dorm.",
		"  Reien Girls Academy had a reputation as a school for princesses, and it was rare indeed for one to be slumming with the common folk.",
		"  That alone would have been enough to cause the ruckus among the boys, but this girl looked the epitome of class.",
		"  One could not help but describe the standing figure as charming.",
		"  The way she silently, motionlessly waited was reminiscent of a meticulously composed portrait.",
		"  Aoko took one look at her before instantly recalling that one word: solitude.",
		"(Okay you lamebrains, don't you have anywhere better to be?)",
		"  Disgusted, Aoko barged through the gate.",
		"  At this point she would normally head home, but today, she crossed the street toward the waiting girl.",
		"\"Oh crap! Is that the student council president?!\"",
		"\"Damn it, she's trying to chase her away! ...Let the girl be! She has a right to stand there if she wants to!\"",
		"\"She's gonna go nuclear! The president versus the angel!\"",
		"\"What gives, man? Who cares if she's from another school! She's not even on school property...right? Right guys?\"",
		"\"Don't mess with Madam Aoko. You're just asking to be smacked.\"",
		"\"...Hah.\"",
		"  The boys ran their mouths behind her back.",
		"  Not in the mood to shut them up, Aoko walked right up to the girl and offered an informal wave.",
		"\"Something the matter, Alice? I told you before, there's nothing of interest for you here.\"",
		"\"For real!?\"",
		"  Aoko heard the boys by the gate lose their collective minds, and did her best to ignore them.",
		"\"I wanted to be sure, but―",
		"Aoko?",
		"  Those people are a nuisance.\"",
		"\"You think? I'll chase them off.\"",
		"  In contrast to Alice's small voice, Aoko spoke loud and clear.",
		"  Naturally, this was on purpose, so as to deal with the riffraff by the gate all at once.",
		"\"Crap, she's coming this way!\"",
		"\"Hey, stop pushing me! Move it! I'm out!\"",
		"\"But... doesn't it look like they're tight? Maybe we could get the prez to introduce us.\"",
		"\"Hahaha. Rookie mistake. You still haven't experienced the realities of the battlefield. On second thought, don't let dreams be dreams. It's your funeral.\"",
		"  Perhaps because too many of them had gathered in one place, the mob entered a frenzied panic as they tried to escape.",
		"Aoko addressed them all.",
		"\"Well, well, well, what do we have here? If it isn't the Go Home Early Club? Would you mind telling me what you're all doing gathered in a place like this with no club activities to attend?\"",
		"\"Eeeep!\"",
		"  The student council president stared daggers at the boys.",
		"\"In any case, exams are coming up.",
		"  It sure would be horrible if, instead of going home to study, you were loitering around just to ogle another school's student, now wouldn't it?",
		"  It's not like a single one of you had the guts to even go up to her and say something.\"",
		"  Not one of them was brave enough to admit that this hit the nail on the head. If any of them had such courage, they would have already been chatting the young lady up.",
		"\"Uh... I think I forgot something in the classroom.\"",
		"\"If I had known it was going to end like this, I would have at least gone down trying.\"",
		"\"What if we go borrow binoculars from the Astronomy Club? I'm sure we could get a good view from the roof.\"",
		"\"The Astronomy Club doesn't have binoculars, dummy! If anyone does, it would be the Wild Bird Society.\"",
		"\"Haha! The prez destroyed those last month! If you have enough time for bird-watching, you have enough time to find a girlfriend, chicken.\"",
		"\"Hahaha. Find a girlfriend? ...S-Sorry, 'Zaki, I'm gonna cut out through the back exit.\"",
		"\"I gotta jet, too! Later, prez! See ya tomorrow!\"",
		"  And with those oh-so-charming remarks, the boys scattered with their tails between their legs.",
		"\"You seem to be enjoying yourself, Aoko.\"",
		"\"How could you tell?\"",
		"  Aoko's response slipped out all too easily.",
		"  In truth, there were not that many bad apples at Misaki High, and dealing with them wasn't really that bad.",
		"\"...So?",
		"  What brings you down here? Did you find something out?\"",
		"\"I identified traces of the witness from within the field. All we need to do now is put a name to them.\"",
		"\"I see. ...Alice, how long have you been waiting here?\"",
		"\"Since school was dismissed.\"",
		"  So she had been here for roughly an hour.",
		"  Standing in the same place for an hour would be taxing for someone as sensitive to the cold as Alice.",
		"\"I'm sorry. If you would have told me...\"",
		"\"...Don't be. I'm just doing it because I wanted to.\"",
		"  As she spoke, her black eyes were fixed upon the gate and the students passing through it.",
		"  She had likely been observing the gate in this manner for the past hour.",
		"\"You're weren't waiting for me, were you? ...Well I'm here now anyway so we can go.\"",
		"  Alice nodded in assent.",
		"  If Alice was still here, it meant she had not found the witness yet.",
		"  If she had found this student, Alice would have already gone home ahead of Aoko and begun to research the student's background.",
		"\"Nothing came up on my end.\"",
		"  She reported the results of Tobimaru's investigation. Alice remained silent.",
		"  With that the conversation ended, leaving the two to silently endure the freezing wind.",
		"  ...The silent stakeout dragged on endlessly.",
		"  Students continued to pass the gate, each shocked at the sight of the unusual combo, and head home.",
		"  After twenty minutes Aoko let a sigh escape her mouth, perhaps from boredom, perhaps from the cold, or perhaps from both.",
		"\"Hey, on our way home, do you want to drop by Dawn?\"",
		"  Aoko quickly turned to Alice to catch her reaction.",
		"  Dawn was the name of one of Aoko's favorite coffee shops.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Offering no clear indication as to whether she was critical of Aoko's blasé attitude or agreeing to her whims, Alice's gaze shifted ever so slightly.",
		"  Aoko followed her stare...",
		"\"Hey, Aozaki. Are you meeting someone here, too?\"",
		"  The sudden voice took her off guard.",
		"  There was only one person who spoke with this gentle, good-natured tone.",
		"\"...Of course it'd be him.\"",
		"  Turning her back to Alice, Aoko moved her focus to the newly appeared student.",
		"\"Can I help you with something?\"",
		"  All politeness flew out the window.",
		"  Already in a bad mood, Aoko's mood plummeted the longer she looked at Soujuurou.",
		"  The subtlety of her expression, however, was lost on him.",
		"\"No thanks, I was just on my way to the station to meet the swimming club captain, and I wanted to say thanks.\"",
		"\"Hmm?\"",
		"  Well, that was completely unexpected.",
		"  Thanks... Joining a club...",
		"  Aoko had a hunch that he was about to say something brainless.",
		"\"...And by 'thanks' you mean 'payback,' right?\"",
		"\"?\"",
		"  Fortunately, Soujuurou was completely unaware of the more sinister implications to the word \"payback.\"",
		"\"I'm not sure what you mean by that, but it's no big deal.",
		"  It's just that the swimming club captain said that the club doesn't get that busy until summer.\"",
		"  Soujuurou was just about to thank her for recommending a club that would not take up much of his time, when Aoko cut him off with an expression of disinterest.",
		"\"Well of course. I couldn't very well introduce you to a club that I knew you would never turn up to. All I did was mention some that even someone as busy as you could join.\"",
		"\"I see. Very efficient.\"",
		"  His open admiration for her sapped Aoko's will to fight.",
		"  Finding a suitable club and negotiating with its captain hadn't been an efficient use of her time at all.",
		"\"Anyway, you really helped me out.",
		"  I just wanted to say thanks.\"",
		"  Soujuurou gratefully dipped his head, but not before the flustered Aoko stopped him.",
		"\"Gimme a break. You're just going to give me a headache if you do that.\"",
		"  ...",
		" So. How's the swimming club? Does it seem like a good fit?\"",
		"  An awkwardness infiltrated her previously sharp gaze.",
		"  Soujuurou was able to pick up on the odd change in her behavior, but could not divine its reason.",
		"  So he simply started with what he knew so far and reported the most recent information he had.",
		"\"Oh, I got kicked out of the club already.\"",
		"\"W-",
		" WHAT?! Why?!\"",
		"  Aoko instinctively shouted at the unexpected response.",
		"  Like a human jack-in-the-box.",
		"  This unexpected development threw her mind in a tizzy and she momentarily forgot the complicated feelings she had been wrestling with.",
		"\"B-B-But you just said that you were on your way to meet the captain!\"",
		"\"Yeah, the captain's taking me to a heated pool in Yashirogi.\"",
		"  Soujuurou stated this very matter-of-factly to the still-reeling Aoko.",
		"\"...I'm not following. Things seem to be going fine. Why would they kick you out?!\"",
		"\"Oh, that's easy. Because I can't swim.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Aoko reached up with her fingers and pinched the bridge of her nose as she processed his answer.",
		"\"Shizuki, do you remember my question from yesterday? The one where I asked whether you preferred running or swimming?",
		"  I'm confident that I remember your answer, but please repeat it to me.",
		"  You said you preferred 'swimming.' Right?\"",
		"\"Yeah. Since I was little, I've always wanted to learn, and I'm already really good at running, so...\"",
		"  Her energy spent, Aoko finally understood.",
		"\"Apparently, they would have taken me in and trained me from square one if I were in my first year.",
		"  Sadly, it sounds like they can't recruit a second-year like me who sinks like a rock, especially with only three months left in the school year.",
		"  But the captain was really nice about it and even offered to teach me how to swim.\"",
		"  Soujuurou's words were spoken from a place of joy, a fact that failed to reach Aoko.",
		"(Hah... So in other words, I tried to palm off defective goods. I'll never be able to show my face to the swimming club captain again.",
		" Wait, but isn't the captain a...)",
		"\"Shizuki, the swimming club captain is...\"",
		"  She stopped herself short of, \"a girl.\"",
		"  She was afraid of how that might look, that she might not be able to rein herself in if she started.",
		"\"...You know what? It doesn't matter. I understand now, so you can just go. Far, far from here, 'kay? I just can't deal with you right now.\"",
		"\"Tobimaru said the same thing, come to think of it. He said that you were unusually tired yesterday and today. Did something happen?\"",
		"\"Kind of. But it's fine. It seems to have resolved itself.",
		"  Anyway... How do I look to you, Shizuki? Do I really look that exhausted?\"",
		"  Why had she asked him this?",
		"  Blurting out things for no reason and on impulse...",
		"  This was not usual for Aoko.",
		"  Perhaps it was because she realized that this would be their last chance to have a normal conversation.",
		"  After a few moments of contemplation, Soujuurou conjured up a grin that cut straight through the tension.",
		"\"Well, I would say you look more lively than you do tired. Like a wolf that's been forced to plow fields for a long time, but is excited to finally go on a hunt again.\"",
		"  He seemed so cheerful.",
		"  Like he was so happy for her.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Without thinking, Aoko's hands went to her cheeks.",
		"  If what he said were true, then she was grinning from ear to ear.",
		"  There was just no way she would have made such a mistake.",
		"\"Anyway, thanks again! See you tomorrow.\"",
		"  Perhaps still not comfortable enough to wave to her, he said his goodbye with sincerity in his voice and smile, and took his leave.",
		"\"Wait. I have a question for you. Then you can go.\"",
		"  Aoko called out after him.",
		"  Her voice was cold as she admonished herself for having been somewhat affable earlier.",
		"\"Yeah?\"",
		"\"This is just a hypothetical question.",
		"  Let's say you're on the brink of starvation and right in front of you are two animals, also starving.",
		"  Someone gives you a gun and tells you to shoot one of them.",
		"  The one on the right is a lion. The one on the left is a kitten. What do you do?\"",
		"  It was a fable-like moral dilemma,",
		"  especially the way in which it  was cruel and rather preachy.",
		"  The kind that if you thought too hard about, you would never find an answer.",
		"  Soujuurou answered quickly and calmly.",
		"\"I don't think I'd shoot at all. You asked me what I'd do, right? And, come on, all three of us are starving.\"",
		"  He was not in the least fazed by the dilemma.",
		"  He gave the most innocent response. So innocent, in fact, that it would give anyone pause.",
		"\"...You're going to live a long life, Shizuki.\"",
		"\"Whoa, you think so? I think that's the first time anyone has ever said that to me.\"",
		"  Adorning his face was a smile wholly out of sync with his comment.",
		"\"...What the heck is that supposed to mean?\"",
		"  She regretted stopping him.",
		"  If only she had just watched him go, this conversation would have never happened.",
		"  Soujuurou Shizuki made his way down the sloped street.",
		"  Today, just like every day, he probably had to work late again.",
		"  Only Aoko and Alice remained, with Alice doing what she could to simply blend in.",
		"\"That harmless hick really throws me for a loop.\"",
		"  Aoko clenched her right fist tightly as she cursed out loud.",
		"  Anything to prevent herself from screaming at the top of her lungs.",
		"  ...Whether that scream would be directed toward Soujuurou or toward herself was another matter entirely.",
		"\"Aoko.\"",
		"  Aoko heard Alice's soft voice behind her. Aoko knew what she was going to say, as she had known for the entire time.",
		"  Ever since Alice, having shown no reaction to any of the other students, changed her expression upon seeing Soujuurou.",
		"\"You don't need to say it. It's him, right? The witness.\"",
		"  Her voice was cold as ice.",
		"  It was the voice of someone talking about a complete stranger.",
		"  ...The lion and the kitten.",
		"  There were pros and cons to choosing either of these animals, the point being that she had asked him to choose one of them.",
		"  In terms of risk, the lion was the more dangerous choice. The instant the gun was pointed at it there was the chance it would fight back.",
		"  Those who chose the lion required more courage, but any sense of guilt that came with holding a gun would be forgotten.",
		"  Lions are fierce creatures-a poor excuse to shoot an animal, perhaps, but one that certainly helped alleviate the guilt.",
		"  But what about the kitten―the weaker creature?",
		"  It goes without saying that the kitten would be the easier target of the two, but choosing it would be a disquieting decision for anyone.",
		"  Even if the kitten had no chance to survive, it was still too senseless to carry out.",
		"  And to Aoko, Soujuurou was that choice.",
		"(...I knew it was him, too.)",
		"  When she had felt that sinking feeling in the student council room, she ignored it; there was no getting around what must be done, she told herself.",
		"Until, that is, Soujuurou went and said what he did, causing her resolve to waver.",
		"  But the discomfort in her chest did not stem from any guilt she may have felt.",
		"  She could care less for Soujuurou; he was weak, and would be incredibly easy to deal with.",
		"  Yet, for some reason she could not dispel her reservations.",
		"  A transfer student who moved to the city from the middle of nowhere, with no family to speak of...",
		"  Few would notice if he were to suddenly disappear compared to a person of some renown. ",
		"  If she were to kill him, it would be as simple as wringing a cat's neck.",
		"  And it all served to just piss her off.",
		"  It was too lucky. Like everything was neatly handed to her. She wanted to just dropkick it right into orbit.",
		"\"I can't believe it. I hate it. This isn't how it's supposed to be.",
		"  ...Why am I like this?\"",
		"  Standing behind her, Alice heard all of the muttering.",
		"  Nevertheless, she seemed ignore it and said,",
		"\"He had something wrapped around his neck.\"",
		"  A wholly unrelated topic.",
		"  Aoko returned to her senses.",
		"\"...His neck?\"",
		"\"...Yes. I wonder if it had something to do with being rejected by the swimming club.\"",
		"  Alice had put much thought into this, as if it had a deeper meaning to her somehow.",
		"\"Now that you mention it... I saw him wearing the same thing the first time we met. I must have missed it because he always has his collar done up.\"",
		"  The conversation turned to idle nonsense. ",
		"  And though it solved none of her current problems, it did help calm Aoko's frazzled nerves.",
		"\"...Thanks, Alice. I'm good.",
		"  I'm ready to go.",
		"  Let's strike while the iron's hot and end this before he spreads any rumors.\"",
		"  Pumped once more, Aoko turned her back to the school gate.",
		"  For now, they would retire to the mansion and prepare for battle.",
		"\"...Sure, but when and where do you plan to kill him?\"",
		"  She said quietly so as not to be overheard by anyone else.",
		"  Normally, Aoko had to rein in that side of Alice, out in the open as they were. But this was far from a normal situation.",
		"\"Tonight. As for the place... We shall meet him in the land of dreams.\"",
		"  She gave a fearless laugh.",
		"  A strangely pleasant sound, like the kind one would make when meeting their lover."
