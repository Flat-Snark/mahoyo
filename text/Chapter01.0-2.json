		"  I suppose it's my fate to die at the hands of Little Red Riding Hood.",
		"  It was a quiet morning.",
		"  From her bed, she could see the sky was an ashen, watercolor gray.",
		"  The thermometer displayed 6 degrees Celsius, a rather unforgiving temperature for November.",
		"  Her stomach woke her up with a growl, pathetically reminding her that she had completely missed breakfast.",
		"  But lazy mornings like today's were, for her, a blessing.",
		"  It was already well past eight in the morning.",
		"  On any ordinary weekday tardiness would be unavoidable, but today, classes were cancelled in commemoration of the school's anniversary.",
		"  Gratefully, she had every intention of taking it easy for the first time in ages.",
		"  Outside the window was a gloomy gray, and it reminded her more of evening than morning.",
		"  It wasn't a pleasant morning by any stretch of the imagination.",
		"  But having been up all night until just three hours ago, she couldn't care less about the weather outside.",
		"  All she cared about was more sleep.",
		"  As long as she could spend her morning in bed, what was happening outside was of no concern to her.",
		"  She shut the curtains.",
		"  Then closed her eyes and tried to let sleep reclaim her.",
		"\"I'd like a nice uneventful dream for two hours, thank you.\"",
		"  Blissful slumber found her soon enough.",
		"  Her consciousness faded.",

		"  A faint but shrill sound lingered in her ears.",
		"  It was the unmistakable ring of a telephone.",
		"  Much to her chagrin, out of habit her eyes popped open.",
		"\"Oh, c'mon. Why today of all days?\"",
		"  The telephone was situated in the foyer on the first floor.",
		"  Answering it meant walking down a ten-meter corridor and going down a flight of stairs.",
		"  In her sleep-deprived state, that distance seemed somewhere between incredibly far and astronomically far.",
		"  The phone's incessant ringing continued.",
		"  She knew the caller would eventually give up if she ignored it, but she chose to fight the urge.",
		"\"Why doesn't Alice answer it?\"",
		"  She thought her housemate would get it, but she soon had to abandon all hope.",
		"  The realization struck that her housemate did not have the day off from school and was likely in class at her prestigious little hilltop academy.",
		"  The caller proved incredibly persistent.",
		"  That persistence made the volume of the ringing seem even louder.",
		"\"Ugh. I'm trying to sleep here!\"",
		"  She was left with no choice but to get up, throw a top on, and leave the room.",
		"\"God, it's cold...\"",
		"  She rubbed her hands together to warm her numb fingers.",
		"  The mansion's heating system was inadequate, to say the least.",
		"  Which meant that Winter was the very worst of uninvited guests.",
		"  Never more so than on a dreary morning as this, when one didn't need to use a thermometer to know how cold it was.",
		"  The mansion sat in the mountains and was surrounded by dense forest. Winter always arrived here first, before moving on to nearby towns.",
		"  The robotic ring of the telephone reverberated throughout the long hallway.",
		"  The mansion's furnishings had been so perfectly maintained that it made the place feel unlived.",
		"  It seemed lonelier than it did splendid.",
		"  Coupled with the dreary morning, it could have passed for a haunted house.",
		"\"Well, it is a haunted house, I suppose.",
		"  It's too large for just the two of us.\"",
		"  She counted more than thirty rings since it first began.",
		"  The caller either had a lot of free time on their hands or had a good understanding of the house's circumstances.",
		"  She had a strong hunch that it was the latter.",
		"  The window above looked out onto a gloomy sky.",
		"  She hastened to catch the unrelenting ring in the act as soon as possible.",
		"  Though she had a feeling that her happy morning might come to a close the moment she caught it.",
		"  It was here that a series of incidents began.",
		"  Apologies for the lack of romance to this tale.",
		"  For whether it be objectively true or merely supposition...",
		"  ...it is always from gloomy and unassuming beginnings that extraordinary events are set into motion.    "
