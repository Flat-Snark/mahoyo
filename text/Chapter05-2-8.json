		"　地上四十メートルの高み。",
		"　遊園地の中心へ向かって延びる<骨組み|レール>の上を、慎重に慎重に、足場を確認しながら登っていく人影が一つ。",
		"「―――、―――」",
		"　押さえつけているのは動悸と呼吸だ。",
		"　今はそんな、わずかな動作すら前進の邪魔になる。",
		"　顔面蒼白でより高い位置を目指しているのは、あろう事か静希草十郎である。",
		"　遥か地上を見下ろせば、コースター乗り場には焼きたてパンたちの群れ。",
		"　入り口で右往左往している彼らは刻一刻と数を増やしながら、レールを登っていく草十郎へ<諸手|もろて>を挙げての応援中。",
		"　もとい、下りてこいとブーイングをあげている。",
		"「……助かった。アレ、高いところは苦手なんだ」",
		"　もちろん草十郎も苦手だが、彼らに包囲されないのなら、これはこれで少しだけマシである。",
		"　追ってきているのは浮遊する卵だけ。",
		"　草十郎は大きく息をついた後、やや前屈みになって、天に向かって延びるコースターを登っていく。",
		"　これで地上四十八メートル。",
		"　ビルで言うなら十六階の高さに相当する。",
		"「っ、―――……！」",
		"　強風が髪をさらう。",
		"　人間は根本的に高所を恐れる生き物だ。",
		"　ことに、このように落下のイメージを想起させる場所では、本人にその気がなくとも膝が震える。",
		"　死を<警戒|けいかい>する本能が、安全な地上への<回帰|かいき>を<促|うなが>している。",
		"　それも無理からぬ事。",
		"　ジェットコースターのレールを人力で登ろうなどと、笑い話を通り越してファンタジーの領域なのだから。",
		"　気圧や強風による妨害。",
		"　本能からの中止勧告、痺れる手足、筋力の衰え、とりとめなく暴走する思考。",
		"仮に命綱をしていようと、五メートルも登れば思考は恐怖で固まってしまう。",
		"　加えて、この苦しみは倍々ゲームだ。",
		"　一メートル進めば、それだけ肉体と精神にかかる負担はいや増していく。",
		"「―――よし。頂上まであと少し―――」",
		"　そんな精神の負担はともかく、体の調子を注意深く<測|はか>りながら草十郎は前進する。",
		"　走りづめだった足は、気を抜いたとたん、膝から崩れかねない。",
		"青子が“草十郎の方が危ない”と念を押したのも、疲労しきった体では危険すぎるからだろう。",
		"「……待てよ。逆を言うと、疲れてなければなんとかなると思ってたんだよな、蒼崎は」",
		"　ふわふわ浮遊する卵を眺めながら、草十郎は思い出し笑いをする。",
		"　こんな無茶をする事になった<顛末|てんまつ>。",
		"　ほんの十分前、ふたりはこんな会話を交わしていた。",
		"「じゃあ次ね。正体が分かった以上、あとはどう壊すかを話しあいましょう」",
		"　にんまりと笑う青子に、ぞぞっと背筋が寒くなる草十郎。",
		"　……思えば、この時から青子は草十郎に無茶をさせる気満々だったのだ。",
		"「どう壊すかって、それなら」",
		"　この鉄柵を外まで壊せる魔術があるのなら考えるまでもないのでは、と手を挙げる草十郎。",
		"　彼がこれまでフラットスナークの本体について意見しなかったのは、ひとえに『分かっていてもどうしようもない』と思っていたからだ。",
		"　が、今は条件が違う。",
		"　青子なら文字通り、不可能に手が届く。",
		"「そうでもないわ。私の目算だと、あと五十メートル分、ギリギリで届かない」",
		"　だめじゃないか、と目で<訴|うった>える草十郎。",
		"　青子は自分の長髪に手をやると、魔力をこめた指で、<一房|ひとふさ>スパッと切った。",
		"「足りない分は努力と根性ってね。",
		"　貴方はできるだけ高いところまで逃げて。頃合いを見て合図をだすから、そうしたらこれを空に放ってくれる？　静希君の役目はそれだけでいいから」",
		"　そう言う青子の視線は、とても“できるだけ”なんて言ってはいなかった。",
		"　彼女はこれみよがしに、遊園地二大アトラクションの一つ、ジェットコースターを見つめている。",
		"「…………。つまり、蒼崎とは別行動をとって、あの怪物たちに追われながら、高いところに逃げこめと？」",
		"「そういうコト。ほら、あのうねうね動き出してるコースターのレールとか、よくない？」",
		"　遊園地に悪魔は二匹いる。",
		"　草十郎ですら「よくない」と即答したくなる笑顔だった。",
		"「……疑いたくはないんだが。",
		"　ホントはあの子とグルで、俺を遠回しに殺そうとしてるんじゃないか？」",
		"「あら。私に殺されるのならいいんでしょう？」",
		"「……人の失言を悪用するのは、よくないと思う」",
		"　とても正気じゃない、とうなだれる草十郎。",
		"　青子の言う通りにしていたらキッツィーちゃんに食べられる前に過労死しそうだ。",
		"「私だって鬼じゃないわ。ほら、こっち向いて。",
		"　おまじない、かけてあげる」",
		"「？」",
		"　軽い接触。",
		"　息と息、肌と肌が触れ合う距離。",
		"「―――、あ」",
		"　おざき、と続く声が弱い。",
		"　それは、一方にとってはごく当たり前の魔術で、",
		"　一方にとっては頭が真っ白になるほどの、柔らかな不意打ちだった。",
		"　　『―――空<気のおも|かるく、よわく>り、<胸のふる|うまく、はやく>え。",
		"　　　　　　ひ<かりは先|チクタクチクタク>立つ、<かげは遅|いそげやいそげ>れる。』",
		"　通常の声帯では発音できない、何か特殊な重みをもった声が草十郎の鼓膜に響く。",
		"　……もし言葉に色が見えたのなら、きっと彼女の名前通りの色だっただろう。",
		"　疲れきっていた体が、熱くなっていた血液が、緩やかに冷やされていく。",
		"　　『<鳥は空に|と　　ぶ>、<魚は海に|お　よ　ぐ>、<貴方は彼方に|か け ぬ け る>。",
		"　　　疑<問も不安も鞄|チクタクチクタク>の底に、旅路<の一歩は|きてきをならせ>曙に。",
		"　　　輝<く星はするりと降|ほしはいつでもきたのそら>ちて、今は<貴方の心の内|どこまでも、いつまでも>に。』",
		"　実際には五秒ほど。",
		"　不意を突かれた彼にとってはもう少しだけ長く感じられた触れ合いは、こうして何の失敗もなく、<名残|なごり>惜しくも完了した。",
		"「よし、暗示成功！　成功したはず！　ここまで手応えがあったの初めてだし！",
		"　有珠の小言もたまには役に立つじゃない！」",
		"　はしゃぐ青子と、とにかく現状が掴めない草十郎。",
		"　今のは一体なんだったのかと訊くと、",
		"「簡単な暗示よ。一時的に恐怖心を消しておいたから、高いところに登っても平気なはず。",
		"　あの手の作業でいちばん足を引っ張るのは動揺でしょ？",
		"　恐怖も何も感じなければ、地上何メートルだろうと平均台とそう変わらないってワケ」",
		"「――――――」",
		"　なるほど、と手を打つ純朴少年。",
		"　青子の言っている事は<眉唾|まゆつば>だが、さっきの謎の行為はそういう事か、と納得する草十郎だった。",
		"「……はあ。やっと、着いた」",
		"　山なりのレールの頂点。",
		"　草十郎は地上六十メートル近い高みに到着し、遊園地を俯瞰する。",
		"　青子の姿はすぐに発見できた。",
		"　この地点からそう離れていない広場で、なにやら怪しげな作業を行っている。",
		"　青子の周囲は静かなものだ。",
		"　ブレッドマンたちは草十郎を追いかけようとして、いまだコースター入り口で試行錯誤の真っ最中。",
		"　距離にして、もう百メートル以上も離れている。",
		"「……汗をかくはずだ。こんなに移動したのか」",
		"　真冬の強風で額の汗はすぐに乾くが、シャツの下は汗で濡れている。",
		"　一キロマラソン以上の運動量プラス、冷や汗分も含まれているに違いない。",
		"「でも良かった。あとは合図を待つだけだ」",
		"　心底から安心する。",
		"　この方法で、青子が<遊園地|スナーク>を破壊できるから、ではない。",
		"　彼はそんな事より、ミラーハウスでの借りを少しでも返せる気がして嬉しいのだ。",
		"　青子のいた広場から青い魔弾が昇る。",
		"「合図だ……！」",
		"　草十郎はレールの上に立ち上がり、ポケットに仕舞った巾着袋を放り投げた。",
		"　ここが不安定な足場である事を考えない、豪快なオーバースロー。",
		"　巾着は放物線を描きながら青子のいる方角に向かっていき、ほどなくして空に<解|と>けた。",
		"　巾着には彼女の髪と、重しの小石が入っていた。",
		"“高いところから風に乗せてくれれば、後はなんとかするから”",
		"　青子はそう言ったが、草十郎なりに工夫した結果である。",
		"　<一房|ひとふさ>の髪は、持ち主である少女を見守るように<滞空|たいくう>する。",
		"　草十郎に託された仕事は終わった。",
		"　いまだ浮遊する卵は気になるが、これは彼にどうにかできる物ではない。",
		"　草十郎はホッと息をついて、事の成り行きを見届けようと身を乗り出し、",
		"「…………むむ？」",
		"　視界の<隅|すみ>。",
		"　青子のいる広場に近寄りつつある、なにか、見覚えのあるものを見かけた気がした。",
		"「<刻印|ルート>、<接続|セット>―――",
		"　直<流数|ディレクト>紋、一層、二層―――予備に三層。",
		"　魔力提供、大源に固定。",
		"　……<循環|じゅんかん>良し、<射角|しゃかく>良し、<術式|じゅつしき>安定、おおまか良し」",
		"　レンガの<路|うえ>に<紋様|もんよう>が刻まれていく。",
		"　かつてない大詠唱による、かつてない大射程の魔術行使。",
		"　ほのかな緊張と高揚を胸に<留|とど>めながら、新米魔術師は指を鳴らす。",
		"「―――決めた。<魔弾|ツアー><形式|プラン>、<収束|スター><投射|マイン>」",
		"　術式の中心に膝をつき、夜空を見上げる青子。",
		"　御伽の国と化した遊園地だったが、もう、その片鱗すら彼女の視界には<映|うつ>らない。",
		"　青い目に映るのは、たったひとつの触れられぬもの。",
		"「実は、ずっと気になっていた事が」",
		"　つい数分ほど前の話。",
		"　そう切りだして、草十郎はある事実を口にした。",
		"　本当に単純な食い違い。",
		"　一時間前までの現実と、たった今の幻想と、その最小にして最大の間違い探しを。",
		"「雲があったから、勘違いしたんだろうけど―――」",
		"　見えているのに見えないもの。",
		"　現実では有りえなくて、ここに有るのもおかしいもの。",
		"　あらゆる原型が変わっていく遊園地で、堂々と、正常なカタチを見せつけていた―――",
		"「今夜は新月なんだ、蒼崎」",
		"「思えば、はじめっからそのカタチだったものね、アンタは」",
		"　月までの距離は三十八万キロメートル。",
		"　本当に<そ|・><こ|・><ま|・><で|・><同|・><じ|・>であるなら、まさしく異名に恥じない怪物だ。",
		"　だが、そうであるのなら姿を隠す必要はない。堂々と正体を明かせばいい。",
		"　正体を隠すのは手の届く位置にいるからこそ。",
		"　あの怪物の擬態は、同時に、人間の手で<到|・><達|・><可|・><能|・>である事を示している……！",
		"「こっちの最大射程は、よくて六百ってところだけど……」",
		"　こうなったら力尽きるまで。",
		"　この遊園地中の魔力を総動員して、魔弾の手を伸ばしてみせる。",
		"　夜空に青い花火が上がる。",
		"　風に舞う自分の髪を見上げて、青子は虚空をつかむように右手を伸ばした。",
		"　魔術師にとって自身の肉体は一線級の触媒だ。",
		"　女性の魔術師であるなら、年月を積み重ねた髪は特に貴重かつ強力な燃料になる。",
		"　扱いはそれこそ念じるだけでいい。",
		"　彼女は力強く、開いた指を握りこみ、",
		"「三層展開！　全術式、連結起動―――！」",
		"　月と自らを<繋|つな>げる、明確な挑戦状をたたきつけた。",
		"　霧が渦巻く。",
		"　中空に現れた青い魔術式を見て、高みの怪物がその牙を<剥|む>きだしにする。",
		"「見抜かれた、ですって……？」",
		"　有珠がその変化に気付いた時、青子、スナークの両者は、ともに明確な敵意を向けあっていた。",
		"「……そう。なら青子の勝ちよ。すぐに戻りなさい。",
		"　たしかに雨雲を消したのはヒントのあげすぎだけど、それぐらいは大目に見て―――スナーク？」",
		"　霧の集結は止まらない。",
		"　夜空に浮かぶ月は、<不遜|ふそん>極まる魔法使いを許しはしない。",
		"　夜の王たる自分を<敬|うやま>わぬばかりか、あんな、あからさまに挑戦状をたたき付けられては、怒りの<収|おさ>めようがない。",
		"「スナーク！」",
		"　あわてて報告に来る駒鳥を手で払いながら、少女は変貌していく黄金の月を凝視する。",
		"　制止の声は届かない。",
		"“童話の怪物”は誰はばかることなく、その強大な力を、ちっぽけな<青子|えもの>に振り下ろそうと―――",
		"　うなりをあげる魔弾の炉心。",
		"　回転する体内の魔術回路。",
		"　架空の炎に神経を焼かれながら、青子は魔力を走らせる。",
		"　地面に刻んだ術式は青子と<連結|リンク>している。",
		"　術式を読みこみ実行するのは今まで通りだが、出力はその比ではない。",
		"　同じ工程でもこれほどの火力なら術者にも害が及ぶ。",
		"　あるいは、<砲身|しんけい>が焼き崩れるほどの。",
		"「―――、でも、いける……！」",
		"　怖いくらいに上昇する架空の熱量。",
		"　底なしの感覚に身震いする青子だが、そうでなくてはこの戦法を選んだ意味がない。",
		"　青子はもう移動できない。",
		"　草十郎からスナークの正体を聞いた時、彼女は“移動する砲台”の優位性を捨てて、設置砲台になる道を選んだ。",
		"　そうでなければ届かない。この位置、この角度で刻印を固定しなければ、スナーク<狩り|ハント>はできないのだ。",
		"　同時に、それは“次の手段”がない事を示している。",
		"　口火をきればこの場所で最後まで戦うしかない。",
		"　それでいい、と青子は大きく息を吸い込んだ。",
		"　準備は万全。ロケットの噴射に等しい魔力の渦を、直接、あの月にまで届かせる―――！",
		"　中空に浮かぶ第三層は臨界に達した魔力を撃ち出す銃口であり、射角を調整する<照星|しょうせい>だ。",
		"“霧……？”",
		"　その照準越しに月が<歪|ゆが>む。",
		"　魔力を充電する青子をあざ笑うように、黄金の月はその正体を現していく。",
		"　さあ―――<宙|てん>を仰げ、異能なき<無|む><辜|こ>の血統。",
		"　あれこそは魔天の一角、",
		"　緑色の霧、<紺碧|こんぺき>の雲にかすむ神秘の<貌|すがた>。",
		"　魔術世界において至宝と称され、",
		"　一つの王国より稀少と値付けられた<至高の幻想|クラウン・ファンタズム>。",
		"“あれが―――フラットスナーク……！！！！”",
		"　<第一|はじまり>より<別|わか>たれた、この世でもっとも大きな虚構！",
		"“っ……まだ早い―――まだ早い、けど―――！”",
		"　これ以上の<猶|た><予|め>は許されない、と本能が叫んでいた。",
		"　正体を暴かれようと敵は最高級の“童話の怪物”。",
		"　この状況でも反撃の用意はある事を、剥き出しの敵意が示している……！",
		"“こっちはもう動けない……逃げを捨てての大詠唱、先に撃たれたらそこで終わりだ……！”　",
		"　故に、その前に撃ち落とす。",
		"　魔力は八分、術式は正常稼働、あとは<引|ひ>き<金|がね>を引くだけだが―――",
		"　本当にそれでいいのか、と冷静な自分が告げる。",
		"　始めてしまえば後戻りはできない。",
		"　この先はコンマの戦いだ。判断ミスを悔いる瞬間さえない。０．１秒の迷いが天秤をかたむける。",
		"　痛みへの覚悟も、失着への開き直りはできているか？",
		"　そもそも本当におまえは、そのちっぽけな魔弾で、月を落とす事ができるのか―――？",
		"“いい―――とりあえず、当たった後で考える！”",
		"　月を見据える<双眸|そうぼう>に決意をこめる。",
		"　魔弾を放った瞬間、強大なフィードバックが全身を打ちのめす事を念頭にいれて、",
		"「―――上等！",
		"　出し惜しみはなし、めいっぱいブン回すわ……！」",
		"　<宙|そら>を狙う狙撃手は気勢と共に、一撃必中、超長射程の魔弾を解き放つ……！",
		"　地上からの魔弾を抱く第三層。",
		"　青子の分身とも言える刻印が、月を射抜けと光を放つ。",
		"　―――だが。",
		"　光を砕く<巨|あ><峰|お>の<天蓋|てんがい>。",
		"　瞬間火炎温度３０００度に匹敵する<架|エ><空|ー><要|テ><素|ル>が、真っ向から無に帰していく……！",
		"「あ、づっ―――！！！！！」",
		"　身に余る大魔術の反動に、全身の血が沸騰する。",
		"　停止した心臓。",
		"　激痛と衝撃で麻痺する<脳髄|のうずい>。",
		"　末端から<壊|え><死|し>していく神経。",
		"　それらすべてを、魔術刻印が強引に蘇生させる。",
		"「は、ぁつ、ぁ―――！」",
		"“氷―――！　氷で<防|ふせ>がれた！”",
		"　真っ白に眩む視界のなか、青子はたしかに見た。",
		"　<口内|こうない>の血を飲みこんで頭上を<睨|にら>む。",
		"　そこには。",
		"巨大な氷塊を盾にしてあざ笑う、いびつで邪悪な<髑髏|どくろ>の顔が……！",
		"“撃つのが遅すぎた、それとも早すぎた……！？",
		"　盾を作られる前に撃てばよかった！？",
		"　それとも、正面からじゃ無謀すぎた……！？”",
		"「っ、どっちでもいい！",
		"　一層、二層、再起動―――！　急いで！」",
		"　考える余分も、迷っている余裕もない。",
		"　遊園地<中|じゅう>の魔力が集結する。",
		"　一方は青子に。",
		"　もう一方は君臨する月の顔に。",
		"　今の氷は未完成だ、と青子は直感した。こちらがそうであったように、フラットスナークもまだ<極限|じょうげん>に達していない。",
		"　そう、だからこそ―――",
		"“まずい―――まずい、まずい、まずい！”",
		"　術式の加速は青子自身を傷つける。",
		"　繋がっている以上、術式に負荷をかけるほど<軋|きし>みは青子の体にのしかかる。それでも今は耐えるしかない。",
		"　なぜなら―――",
		"“―――あの氷、<私|・><の|・><マ|・><ッ|・><ク|・><ス|・><よ|・><り|・><も|・><っ|・><と|・><上|・><だ|・>！”",
		"　今の一撃で互いの戦力が分かってしまった。",
		"　魔力量こそ同じでも、<神秘|カタチ>を成す術式の強度が違う。",
		"　青子が限界まで魔力を充電しても、ようやく<今|・><の|・><氷|・><塊|・>を打ち抜ける程度なのだ。",
		"　<即|すなわ>ち、スナークが限界まで魔力を集めた場合、何をやっても圧し負ける……！",
		"「なら、その前に―――！」",
		"　次弾を装填する。",
		"　空中の第三層に命令を届かせる。",
		"　体への負担を無視して一層の術式を加速させる。",
		"　右手の一層は周囲の魔力を吸収、蓄電する役割だ。",
		"　遊園地を覆う濃霧。フラットスナーク自身がはき出した太古の<魔力|エーテル>が、術式に注ぎ込まれる。",
		"　当然、術式と一体化している青子の身体は、許容量をはるかに超えた魔力に悲鳴をあげる。",
		"　いや、歓喜にうち<震|ふる>える。",
		"　魔術師にとって、魔力とは神秘に至る為の推進剤。",
		"　体内時間の膨張。",
		"　自我の融解。",
		"　肉体からの解放。",
		"　言ってしまえば臨死体験。",
		"　そのギリギリの境界で、青子は現実を直視する。",
		"“――――――”",
		"　……その現実が、激痛に耐える意志を、折りにくる。",
		"　誰であろうと差は歴然。",
		"　蒼崎青子という砲身では、",
		"　あの氷塊を<削|けず>る事さえできはしまい―――",
		"“っ、<痛|そ><み|れ>が―――”",
		"　術式をなお加速させる。",
		"　髑髏が笑う。",
		"氷塊は盾ではない。",
		"アレは身を<弁|わきま>えない魔術師を押しつぶすもの。",
		"遊園地全体を<陥没|かんぼつ>させる<氷塊|いちげき>で、青子だけでなく、コースターの上にいる彼さえも踏み砕こうと笑っている。",
		"“どうした―――！！！！”",
		"　臨界寸前の魔術回路。",
		"指先はおろか眼球まで焼く電荷。",
		"　それでも魔弾の引き金を<絞|しぼ>る。",
		"　神経の伝達速度で魔術式を<強化|アレンジ>する。",
		"　一撃では越えられない。",
		"　側面から撃つ手段はない。",
		"　なら、<試|や>るべき<手段|こたえ>は明白すぎる―――！",
		"“<再接続|セレクタ>、<交流数紋|オルタネイト>……！”",
		"　変革する第三層。",
		"　直流から交流へ。本来なら軌道の変化を得意とする術式だが、今は単純に数が欲しい……！",
		"「<接続|セット>、<八芒星|オクタグラム>―――！",
		"　全界層、ブン回せ―――！」",
		"　遊園地を照らす青い太陽。",
		"　最大出力の光弾が、黄金の月を射止めに走る。",
		"「こ、のぉ……！」",
		"　引き金は<絞|しぼ>ったまま、際限なく取りこむ魔力を、休むことなく放ち続ける。",
		"“っ―――、ぁ―――…………”",
		"　臨界域から噴き出される青い炎。",
		"　だが氷塊は融解さえしない。",
		"　温度以前に、カタチ取られた魔力量が違いすぎる。",
		"　体内の魔術回路の負荷が、鮮血となって荒れ狂う。",
		"“っ……！！　これだけ、回して、るのに―――",
		"　アイツの方が、ぜんぜん、上……！”",
		"　この戦いは遊園地に満ちた魔力の奪い合いでもある。",
		"　もとよりここはスナークの庭。",
		"　空間の支配率はスナークが八割、青子は二割にすぎない。",
		"「だ、め……止められ、ない……！」",
		"“あ……”",
		"　勝敗を告げるように、氷の城が落ちてくる。",
		"「あ―――ああ、ああぁああ……！」",
		"　青子にできるのはその結末を遅らせる程度。",
		"　追いつめられるだけと分かっていながら、今は魔弾を撃ち続けるしかない。",
		"　ああ、でも―――今ならまだ、他に手はある。",
		"　この魔力をすべて防御に回せば、万が一―――いや、高い確率で、<青子|じぶん>だけは助かるのでは、と―――",
		"“……っ、うるさい！",
		"　ここの魔力を使い切れば、あの氷だって……！”",
		"　破綻した希望にすがって青子は回路を回し続ける。",
		"　魔力の<過剰摂取|オーバードウズ>で停止する時間。",
		"　永遠に続く一秒の激痛。",
		"　その中で、",
		"“―――え？”",
		"　何かが、ひたひたと、",
		"　何かが、遊園地の物陰から、",
		"　何かが、",
		"何かが、",
		"何かが、",
		"“ちょっ―――”",
		"　全身が総毛立つ。",
		"　頭上の氷塊なんて問題じゃない。",
		"　静止した時間の中で、ひたひたと、赤い死がやってくる。",
		"“なんで、こんな、ところで…………！”",
		"　恐怖で<回路|せいしん>が破裂しかける。",
		"　<術式|こころ>の形成がほころびかける。",
		"　ソレは彼女の背後にまでやってきて、",
		"　ひたり、と。",
		"　血まみれの手で、後ろから青子の両頬に手を当てて、",
		"　　　　　　　　　",
		"『こんにち　は』",
		"“！！！！！”",
		"　あらゆる感情、あらゆる自我が絶叫したがる。",
		"　もういい。どうでもいい、なんでもいい！",
		"　逃げられるのなら逃げてしまえ！",
		"　隠しているのなら明かせばいい！",
		"　使えるのなら、そんなもの、いっそ無慈悲に使えばいい！",
		"　そうだ。",
		"　彼女は起死回生の切り札を持っている。",
		"　あんな氷塊、あんな玩具なんて物ともしない奇蹟を、ある日、ポンと冗談みたいに手渡された。",
		"　　　　　　　　　　／それを、この赤い死が殺しに来る。",
		"　使えば破滅。",
		"　使わずとも氷に潰されて死滅。",
		"　なら、どうしてためらう必要がある？",
		"　別に使用制限なんてものはない。",
		"　等価に何かが失われる事もない。",
		"　ただ、彼女が彼女でなくなるだけ。",
		"　たったそれだけ。",
		"　人間なんて曖昧なものだ。",
		"　脳の電流は一分ごとに何十回と断線して、何一つ、“いつまでも続いている<自|も><分|の>”なんてない。",
		"　それは別段、<軽蔑|けいべつ>する事でもなく。",
		"　それは格段、<禁忌|きんき>するものでもない。",
		"“―――っ、さい”",
		"　なのに、口から漏れた声は怒りだった。",
		"　赤い影はかすかに首をかしげる。",
		"　少女は声なき声で叫ぶ。",
		"　魔法を使えば勝てる？　事情も知らないでよくも勝手な。",
		"　だいたい、そもそも―――",
		"“あんなの、どうやって使えってぇのよ―――！”",
		"　彼女には、その魔法とやらの有効な利用法が、どうにも思い当たらない―――！",
		"「―――って、バカか私……！」",
		"　一瞬の錯覚から目を覚ます。",
		"　折れようとしていた心が見せた幻。",
		"　最低ラインの弱音が、逆に少女の<誇|ほこ>りに火をつけた。",
		"『―――逃げるのか？』",
		"　そうだ。自分は王手をかけられているが、それは相手も同じこと。なぜ負けているかは明白で、あとは対策を立てるだけ。それは十分に実行可能だ。",
		"たしかに無茶な話だけど、試す前から諦めるのは許されない。",
		"“……そうだ。",
		"　放りだすのは、やれる事を全部やってから……！”",
		"　もう感覚さえ無い指を握りしめる。",
		"　思考に浮かんだ無理難題は、正気を疑う大博打だ。",
		"　はじめの一歩をコンマでも間違えれば、その時点で青子の体は蒸発する。",
		"　ああ、でも―――",
		"　彼女は、逃げなかった少年を知っている。",
		"　絶体絶命の窮地なのにギリギリまで耐え続けた、ちっぽけでも輝ける、強い勇気を知っている。",

		"  Over forty meters high.",
		"  One careful step at a time, the figure made its way gingerly up the track stretching into the heart of the amusement park.",
		"\"-, -\"",
		"  He stayed his beating chest and the pounding of his breath.",
		"  Even tiny movements were an obstacle to his progress.",
		"  Amazingly, the one making this pale-faced advance higher and higher was Soujuurou Shizuki.",
		"  Far below, he saw a horde of bread creatures had congregated by the roller coaster platform.",
		"  As they bustled this way and that, their numbers continued to increase by the minute, seemingly cheering on Soujuurou with raised arms as he made his ascent.",
		"  Or jeered him more like, beckoning him to come down.",
		"\"...Well, at least they don't like heights.\"",
		"  Of course, neither did Soujuurou, but his current state was the lesser of two evils.",
		"  The only thing that followed him now was the floating egg.",
		"  After heaving a huge sigh, Soujuurou bent forward a bit and climbed the track that reached to the heavens.",
		"  Forty eight meters now.",
		"  If this were a skyscraper, he would be on the sixteenth floor.",
		"\"...!\"",
		"  A strong gust of wind whipped through his hair.",
		"  Humans had an instinctual fear of heights.",
		"  In particular, a place like this, which called forth visions of falling to one's death, would cause a person's knees to tremble against their will.",
		"  It was an instinct that forewarned death, urging its master to return to the safety of the ground.",
		"  It was a reasonable reaction.",
		"  Climbing the roller coaster tracks went beyond funny stories and into the realm of fantasy.",
		"  The strong winds and change in air pressure were a hindrance.",
		"  His instincts screamed at him to stop, causing his limbs to go numb, his muscles to go limp, and his mind to race.",
		"Even if he had been tied to a lifeline, a mere five meters of climbing would still have caused his thoughts to freeze out of sheer terror.",
		"  And it would only get worse from here, exponentially so.",
		"  Every meter forward increased the load on both his mind and his body by another degree.",
		"\"...I can do this. Just a little bit more to the top...\"",
		"  The burden on his mind notwithstanding, he carefully measured the toll on his body with every step.",
		"  His legs, which had carried him running this far, threatened to buckle the moment he let down his guard.",
		"This fatigue was likely why Aoko had stressed that Soujuurou's role was more dangerous than hers.",
		"\"Wait. Would Aozaki have been so worried if I wasn't tired?\"",
		"  Soujuurou laughed as he stared at the floating egg.",
		"  He reflected on the course of events that had led to this absurd situation.",
		"  Not even ten minutes ago they had been engaged in conversation.",
		"\"Okay. Since we know what form it's taken, we need to talk about how we're going to destroy it.\"",
		"  Soujuurou felt a shudder travel down his spine at Aoko's smug grin.",
		"  In hindsight, Aoko had been more than happy at this point to make him do something absurd.",
		"\"So by 'destroy it,' you mean we're going to...\"",
		"  Soujuurou had spoken up figuring that what he was about to say was silly, especially considering Aoko had the magecraft to tear clean through the fence.",
		"  Furthermore, up till now, he had not once offered his insight as to the true form of Flat Snark only due to his belief that there was nothing they could have done about it even if they were the wiser.",
		"  But that had changed.",
		"  For Aoko, the impossible was quite literally within her grasp.",
		"\"I know what you were going to say, and no. By my estimate, I wouldn't get within a fifty meters of the thing.\"",
		"  Despair filled Soujuurou's eyes.",
		"  Aoko lifted a hand to her long hair and, with the magical energy in her fingertip, cut a clean tuft from her head.",
		"\"Not if we make up the difference with some elbow grease.",
		"  Get to the highest place you can. When the time is right, I'll give you a sign. Just toss this into the air. That's all you need to do.\"",
		"  But based on where Aoko pointed her gaze, she did not really mean to leave it up to Soujuurou to pick the highest place he could find.",
		"  Aoko was staring conspicuously at one of the amusement park's two main attractions: the roller coaster.",
		"\"...So, in other words, you're saying we split up, then you want me to run away from the monsters chasing me and escape to somewhere high, right?\"",
		"\"Exactly. And hey, wouldn't you know it, the tracks of that winding roller coaster are perfect!\"",
		"  There were two demons in this park.",
		"  Her smile made even Soujuurou want to respond that it was far from perfect.",
		"\"Far be for me to question your motives here, but...",
		"  You're not secretly working with that girl to kill me, are you?\"",
		"\"Now now. Wasn't it you who said it was okay if I was the one who killed you?\"",
		"\"...It's not nice to twist other people's words.\"",
		"  Soujuurou hung his head. This was not sane.",
		"  If he did as she said, he would die from exhaustion before Kitsy even had a chance to eat him.",
		"\"I'm not a monster. Hey, Look at me.",
		"  I'll cast a charm on you.\"",
		"\"...?\"",
		"  It was the lightest of touches.",
		"  Close enough for their breath and skin to come in contact.",
		"\"... But Ao...\"",
		"  \"...-zaki,\" he finished with a hushed voice.",
		"  For one of them, this was a rather mundane magecraft.",
		"  For the other, it was a head-spinning sneak attack of intimacy.",
		"            \"<The weight of the air, the tremble of one's breast|Be light and frail, nimble and fast.>.",
		"                    <Light lags behind while shadows pull ahead.|Tick-tock, tick-tock, there's no time to waste.>\"",
		"  Words that could not be produced by a normal larynx, carrying a peculiar weight to them, reverberated against his eardrums.",
		"  If words were given colors, these would have been the color of her name: blue.",
		"  Soujuurou's exhausted body and burning blood gently cooled.",
		"        \"<A bird in the sky, a fish in the sea, you in the distance|Fly, swim, run.>.",
		"        <Stuff doubt and anxiety in a sack.|Tick-tock, tick-tock.> <Begin the journey at dawn|Sound the alarm.>.",
		"        <A shining star falls,|The star is always in the northern sky,> <into your heart.|no matter where you go.>\"",
		"  In reality it took but a few seconds.",
		"  But the sudden contact had felt a little longer, until it ended.",
		"\"Mesmerize successful! ...I think. This is the first time I've actually felt it take!",
		"  I guess all those lectures from Alice paid off!\"",
		"  A very merry Aoko stood aside a very confused Soujuurou.",
		"  After he asked what the heck had occurred, she responded.",
		"\"It's an elementary suggestion. I temporarily erased your sense of fear, so you should be able to climb up there no problem.",
		"  The biggest thing standing in your way is your nerves, right?",
		"  If you don't feel fear, then no matter how high you climb, it's no different from walking a balance beam!\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  He seemed to get it...",
		"  It actually all sounded like Greek to Soujuurou, but he accepted it as an explanation of her strange actions.",
		"\"Hah... Finally, I made it.\"",
		"  He'd arrived at the summit of the track.",
		"  At a height of nearly sixty meters, Soujuurou had a bird's-eye view of the entire amusement park.",
		"  He was able to spot Aoko's figure right away.",
		"  In the plaza not so far from here, she seemed to be occupied with something conspicuous.",
		"  Her surroundings lay still.",
		"  The bread men were still busy trying to figure how to reach Soujuurou by trial and error from the roller coaster's entrance.",
		"  They had over hundred meters of distance to cover.",
		"\"No wonder I'm drenched in sweat. Look how much ground I've covered.\"",
		"  The strong winter gales quickly dried the sweat on his brow, but he was drenched underneath his shirt.",
		"  This much sweat was worth at least a one-kilometer run, not to mention all the scares he had experienced throughout the night.",
		"\"Okay. Now all I have to do is wait for the signal.\"",
		"  He felt a wave of relief,",
		"  but not at the thought of Aoko destroying the Snark and this nightmarish park.",
		"  He was simply happy that he could repay a bit of his debt from the house of mirrors.",
		"  A blue bullet rose from the plaza where Aoko was located.",
		"\"That's the signal!\"",
		"  Soujuurou stood up atop the tracks, pulled out the pouch he had stowed in his pocket, and tossed it forward.",
		"  Without any regard for his questionable footing, he gave it a mighty overarm pitch.",
		"  The small pouch drew a parabolic curve in Aoko's direction, quickly becoming untied in mid-air.",
		"  Inside the bag was the lock of her hair and a small stone weight.",
		"\"Just throw it with the wind from somewhere high up, and I'll take it from there.\"",
		"  Aoko had said, but it was Soujuurou's effort that had set the plan in motion.",
		"  The tuft of hair remained airborne, drifting as if watching over its owner.",
		"  Soujuurou's job was done.",
		"  His remained concerned about the egg hovering over him, but there was nothing he could do about it.",
		"  Soujuurou breathed a sigh of relief, and leaned forward to watch the rest of the plan unfold, but then...",
		"\"Hmm?\"",
		"  In the corner of his eye,",
		"  he thought he spotted something familiar approaching Aoko.",
		"\"<Connecting to Crest.|Routing... Set.>\"",
		"  Direct current: First layer, second layer... third layer in reserve.",
		"  Magical energy supply fixed to greater source.",
		"  Flow, check. Angle, check. Formula stability, good enough.\"",
		"  A pattern began to carve itself into the brick street.",
		"  The casting of an unprecedented incantation with unprecedented range.",
		"  Keeping the rising tension contained within her chest, the fledgling mage snapped her fingers.",
		"\"Done. <Bullet configuration|Tour Plan>:<convergent launch!|Starmine!>\"",
		"  She kneeled at the center of the formula and raised her head to the night sky.",
		"  Not even a glimpse of the transmogrified fantasy land around her entered her vision now.",
		"  Only one thing, one untouchable thing, was reflected in her blue eyes.",
		"\"So, this has been on my mind for a while now...\"",
		"  This is how their conversation started a few minutes prior.",
		"  Soujuurou began with a simple statement of fact.",
		"  In truth, it really was the simplest of discrepancies.",
		"  Between the reality of an hour ago and the illusion of the present; a difference both infinitesimal and infinite at the same time.",
		"\"I thought maybe I didn't know what I was looking at because of the clouds...\"",
		"  It was something hiding in plain sight.",
		"  Something both seemingly impossible in reality and unusual given its location.",
		"  In this amusement park where every paradigm had shifted, something was brazenly flaunting its normalcy.",
		"\"Tonight is supposed to be a new moon, Aozaki.\"",
		"\"Yeah... Come to think of it, that was its original form.\"",
		"  The distance from the Earth to the moon was 380,000 kilometers.",
		"  If it truly was identical to the actual moon, then this monster indeed lived up to its eerie reputation.",
		"  A distance that far would have meant that it had no need to hide its form. It could flaunt its true form in front of all.",
		"  But due to the very fact that it was hiding its true form, it meant it must have been within reach.",
		"  That monster's camouflage implied that it sat within the reach of human hands.",
		"\"At best, my max range is 600 meters or so...\"",
		"  At this point, it was time to give it all she had.",
		"  Drawing on the energy surging throughout the park, she extended her firing arm.",
		"  A blue firework launched into the air.",
		"  Looking up at her hair dancing in the wind above, Aoko reached out her right hand as if to catch the night sky.",
		"  A mage's own body made for the perfect catalyst.",
		"  And for a female mage, the hair she had grown out over many years made for a particularly valuable and powerful source of fuel.",
		"  To use it, all she had to do was apply her will.",
		"  She locked the fingers on both her hands together and shouted,",
		"\"Deploy third layer! All formulae, commence linked activation!\"",
		"  She hurled forth a clear challenge to bind the moon to herself.",
		"  The mist began to whirl about in a vortex.",
		"  The monster high above bore its fangs at the sight of the blue spell that appeared in midair.",
		"\"Did she figure it out...?\"",
		"  By the time Alice had noticed the change, the hostility between Aoko and the Snark was palpable.",
		"\"...Very well. This round goes to Aoko. Return immediately.",
		"  Perhaps removing the rain clouds was too obvious a hint, but I suppose one can't win them―Flat Snark?\"",
		"  The fog continued to thicken with no sign of abating.",
		"  The moon that floated in the night sky could not pardon such an insolent mage.",
		"  As if the lord of the night would bow down to such impudence; there was no staying its wrath at a challenge so flagrant.",
		"\"Snark!\"",
		"  The robin swooped in to give its report, but Alice waved it away. Her gaze was fixed on the transforming golden moon.",
		"  Her calls of restraint did not reach it.",
		"This fairy-tale monster was beholden to nobody, and it would have no qualms unleashing its vast might upon its puny prey.",
		"  The core of her magic bullet howled.",
		"  The Magic Circuits within her body spun.",
		"  Aoko fed them magical energy, scorching her nerves with imaginary flame.",
		"  She was linked to the formula inscribed on the ground.",
		"  The spell was read and executed the same as it always was, but its output was beyond reckoning.",
		"  With this much firepower, even this mundane process would invite injury upon its caster.",
		"  It was enough to burn up the nerves that were acting as the barrel.",
		"\"Hnnngh... I can... do this!\"",
		"  The imaginary heat had reached a terrifying temperature.",
		"  Aoko trembled at this endless feeling, but would have to grin and bear it lest their efforts come to naught.",
		"  Aoko could no longer move.",
		"  When she had learned the Snark's true form from Soujuurou, she gave up on any superiority a moveable turret offered, instead opting to become a stationary cannon.",
		"  That was the only way she could reach it. It was impossible to hunt the Snark unless she anchored her crest at this location and angle.",
		"  At the same time, this action revealed that she was out of options.",
		"  Once the fuse was lit, she would have no choice but to fight to the bitter end.",
		"  Aoko took a deep breath; this was the way she wanted it.",
		"  Her preparations were complete. She would be able deliver this maelstrom of magical energy directly to the moon, like a rocket payload!",
		"  The third layer floating in midair served as the cannon's muzzle and sight. It would fire the magical energy once it reached criticality, and it allowed Aoko to adjust the angle of fire.",
		"\"Fog...?\"",
		"  The moon became warped within her scope.",
		"  As Aoko charged her magical energy, the Ploy displayed its golden form, as if to mock her.",
		"  Come. Worship the heavens, powerless scion of an innocent bloodline.",
		"  For there it was, a point among the otherworldly sky,",
		"  a Mystical visage obfuscated by jade mists and azure clouds.",
		"  Called the greatest treasure known to the world of magecraft,",
		"  a rarity more valuable than an entire kingdom: Crown Phantasm.",
		"(That's it! That's Flat Snark!)",
		"  Set apart from the very beginning, the world's greatest fabrication!",
		"(N-Not yet! Just need a little more time...)",
		"  Her instincts screamed at her to delay no further.",
		"  This fairy-tale monster was the greatest of its kind, and its true form was about to be exposed.",
		"  Its open hostility indicated that it was making preparations for a counterattack.",
		"(I can't move! Not with an incantation this large! If it attacks before me, it's all over!)",
		"  She had to shoot it down first.",
		"  Magical energy was at eighty percent. The formula was operating normally. All that was left was to pull the trigger, but...",
		"  The calm voice inside her head asked if that was really okay.",
		"  She had one shot at this, and there was no going back.",
		"  It was a battle of precision with no room for miscalculations. Even a tenth of a second of hesitation would tip the scales.",
		"  Was she ready for the pain? Was she ready to deal with the fallout if she missed?",
		"  Could she really even take down the moon with such a tiny bullet in the first place?",
		"(Enough! Shoot first, ask questions later!)",
		"  Her eyes, fixed upon the moon, were filled with determination",
		"  and an awareness that the moment she fired, the intense recoil would overwhelm her entire body. She shouted,",
		"\"...Bring it on!",
		"  I'm gonna send this thing spinning with all I've got!\"",
		"  With every ounce of spirit she possessed, she fired her ultra-long-range projectile into the sky.",
		"  The third layer embraced the magic bullet fired from the surface of the Earth.",
		"  The crest, an extension of Aoko's self, unleashed light to pierce the moon.",
		"  However...",
		"  An enormous, blue canopy pulverized the beam.",
		"  It returned the Ether, that 3000-degree flame, to nothing as it came in contact with the bullet.",
		"\"Argh! Rrrrgh!\"",
		"  The recoil of the grand magecraft literally boiled her blood. Her body couldn't handle it.",
		"  Her heart stopped.",
		"  Her brain went numb from the pain and impact.",
		"  Her nerves putrefied from end to end.",
		"  But her Magic Crest revived them all by force.",
		"\"Ah...  Gah...!\"",
		"(Ice? It was blocked by ice!)",
		"  Even though her vision had gone white, she could still see it.",
		"  Swallowing the blood in her mouth, Aoko looked up with a scowl.",
		"  There it was,",
		"an enormous shield of ice and a sneering, deformed skull.",
		"(Did I fire too late? Did I fire too early?!",
		"  Should I have shot before it made that shield?",
		"  Was it too reckless to shoot it head-on?!)",
		"\"Who cares?!",
		"  First layer, second layer, reactivate! Hurry!\"",
		"  There was no time to think or hesitate.",
		"  The magical energy throughout the park began to gather.",
		"  Aoko knelt,",
		"  across from the tyrannical face of the moon.",
		"  Aoko intuited that the ice had yet to fully form; Flat Snark still hadn't reached its full strength.",
		"  Which was exactly why...",
		"(Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!)",
		"  By accelerating the spell, Aoko had damaged her own body.",
		"  Aoko sat up and braced herself for the pain caused by the load placed on the formula after linking with the Snark. All she could do was endure it.",
		"  All because...",
		"(That ice is tougher than my best shot!)",
		"  Aoko had gotten a read on their relative strengths.",
		"  Even if its volume of magical energy was identical, Snark's form―its Mystic―was in a different league.",
		"  Even if Aoko charged her energy to her absolute limit, she would barely make a dent in the ice wall.",
		"  Meaning, if the Snark gathered as much energy as it could, there was nothing she could do to prevent her annihilation.",
		"\"Then, before that happens...!\"",
		"  She loaded her next shot.",
		"  She issued orders to the floating third layer.",
		"  Ignoring the toll on her body, she began to accelerate the first layer formula.",
		"  The role of her right hand's single layer was to absorb and store surrounding magical energy.",
		"  The thick fog that drifted through the park was an ancient Ether spewed out by Flat Snark's own body, but Aoko could pour it into her formula.",
		"  Aoko's body, which had integrated with the formula, took on an amount of magical energy that far surpassed its maximum capacity. It seethed in agony.",
		"  Or rather, it trembled in delight.",
		"  For a mage, magical energy was a propellant to reach the realm of Mystics.",
		"  The expansion of internal time...",
		"  The liquefaction of the self...",
		"  The release from the physical...",
		"  What one might call a near-death experience...",
		"  Aoko stood face-to-face with reality on the boundary between it and such concepts.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  And that reality was here to break her will.",
		"  To any bystander, the gap between them would be plain to see.",
		"  The gun barrel named Aoko Aozaki...",
		"  She had not a chance to chip away at that lump of ice.",
		"(This pain...!)",
		"  She accelerated the spell further.",
		"  The skull grinned.",
		" That ice was no shield.",
		" It was something to be used to crush mages who did not know their place.",
		" The moon laughed as it prepared to crush not just Aoko, but the boy atop the roller coaster, as well as the park in its entirety.",
		"(Come on, give me more!!!)",
		"  Her circuits were on the verge of going critical.",
		"Her body had been charged with a scorching power supply from her fingertips to her eyeballs.",
		"  She would see to it that the bullet fired.",
		"  That the magecraft formula would be strengthened as quickly as her nerves' transmission speed would allow.",
		"  A single attack was not enough.",
		"  There was no way to shoot it from its flank.",
		"  Which meant there was only one solution.",
		"\"<Reconnecting to alternating current!|Alternate selector!>\"",
		"  The third layer began to transform.",
		"  It switched from direct to alternating current. The spell's supposed strong point was its ability to adjust its trajectory mid-flight, but right now all she wanted was numbers.",
		"\"<Connecting.|Set.>... Octogram!",
		"  All layers, max rotation!\"",
		"  A blue sun shined down upon the amusement park.",
		"  Beams of light at maximum output streaked forth to pierce the golden moon.",
		"\"Take...this...!\"",
		"  Holding down the trigger, she continued to fire, taking in energy ad infinitum.",
		"\"Gah... Ahgh...\"",
		"  Blue flames shot forth at critical level.",
		"  But the ice would neither melt nor mar. ",
		"  No amount of sheer heat could make a dent in something formed from such a colossal amount of magical energy.",
		"  The toll on her circuits sent them berserk, and blood began to run free.",
		"(...Agh! The spin should have been more than enough...",
		"  He's...just...too strong!)",
		"  The battle had become a tussle over the magical energy that filled the park.",
		"  From the very beginning, this had been the Snark's home turf.",
		"  The Snark had control over at least eighty percent of the space, while Aoko had twenty at best.",
		"\"N-No... I...can't...stop it!\"",
		"(No...)",
		"  The castle of ice descended as if to call the match.",
		"\"Ah...AaaAAAhhhHHH!\"",
		"  All she could do was delay the inevitable.",
		"  She knew that she had been backed into a wall, and right now, the only thing she could do was to keep firing.",
		"  Then again, perhaps not. There was another option.",
		"  If she converted all of her magical energy into a defense, there was a tiny chance―no, not tiny. A great possibility, in fact, that she could save just her―",
		"Shut up and do it already!",
		"  Not even that ice has a chance against all the magical energy here!",
		"  Clinging to that broken hope, Aoko continued to rotate her circuits.",
		"  Time seemed to stop at the magical energy overdose.",
		"  A second of intense pain lasted an eternity.",
		"  Then, amidst everything...",
		"\"Huh?\"",
		"  Something approached one step at a time.",
		"  Something from among the park's shadows.",
		"  Something...",
		" Something...",
		" Something...",
		"(W-Wait...)",
		"  She felt goosebumps from head to toe.",
		"  The issue was no longer the ice overhead.",
		"  In the midst of this stillness, the red death drew closer, step by ominous step.",
		"(Why here, why now?)",
		"  Her circuits and her mind began to rupture out of terror.",
		"  The composition of her formula and soul began to rip apart.",
		"  There it was, just behind her.",
		"  Its footsteps came to a halt.",
		"  It reached around and cupped her face in its bloodstained hands.",
		"                                                ",
		"\"Greetings.\"",
		"\"!!!\"",
		"  She wanted to scream out with all her might.",
		"  This is it. Nothing matters! I couldn't care less!",
		"  Run or don't run, it doesn't matter!",
		"  Quit hiding and reveal yourself!",
		"  Use whatever you can, and show no mercy!",
		"  That was it.",
		"  She had one final card to play.",
		"  A miracle that would treat that ice like nothing more than a toy, gifted to her as a mere amusement.",
		"                    That was what the red death had come to kill.",
		"  Using it would spell ruin.",
		"  And not using it would mean death by ice.",
		"  But why would Aoko hesitate?",
		"  There were no conditions limiting her.",
		"  There would be no price to pay by employing it here.",
		"  She simply would cease to be herself.",
		"  That was all.",
		"  Humans loved to exist in areas of gray.",
		"  Dozens of electrical impulses disconnect in the brain every minute; nothing lasts forever, not even one's self.",
		"  It was not anything particularly worthy of disdain.",
		"  It was not even anything remarkably worthy of being called taboo.",
		"(...Shut up.)",
		"  What escaped her lips now was rage.",
		"  Bewilderment from the red silhouette.",
		"  The girl let out an inaudible scream.",
		"  Could True Magic truly be her savior? What an opportunistic load of bull.",
		"  After all, to begin with...",
		"(I have no clue how to do that shit yet!)",
		"  Indeed, Aoko was still in the dark when it came to that Magic, whatever it was.",
		"\"...I'm such a moron!\"",
		"  She woke from her momentary hallucination.",
		"  The very illusion her breaking soul had shown her.",
		"  Whining had had the opposite effect on her; her pride was now ablaze.",
		"\"You can escape, too.\"",
		"  Soujuurou was right. Her opponent had put her in check, but she had done the same to it. It was clear why she was losing, so now all she needed was a counter-plan, well within her abilities.",
		"No matter the odds, she was not one to give up without giving it one last shot.",
		"(That's right.",
		"  Giving up only comes after you've tried absolutely everything!)",
		"  Her numbed fingers clenched into a tight fist.",
		"  She was betting against the house, an unreasonable gamble that should have made her question her sanity.",
		"  If her first step was off by an inch, her body would be instantly vaporized.",
		"  But...",
		"  She knew a boy who never fled.",
		"  She knew of a steadfast courage that could shine its light, no matter how small, through any desperate situation.",
		"  Yes. There was more than just herself to be concerned about.",
		"  If that ice fell, it would mean the destruction of the park in its entirety.",
		"  Everything he had achieved, everything he had risked and dared and happily put his life on the line for, would all be for naught.",
		"(...Really.",
		"  What possessed him to be so bullheaded?!)",
		"  Determination and confidence surged through her like electricity.",
		"  She was in no mood to be crushed by a giant sheet of ice.",
		"  If she was going to lose, she'd rather do so as the grandest firework possible.",
		"  Aoko was a sore loser. At this point, she would rather burn herself to cinders than let it decide her end.",
		"\"<Disconnect! Expand area! Reconnect!|Change, change, change!>\"",
		"She grunted in pain.",
		"  Energy raged through her body.",
		"  Her circuits were on the verge of disintegration.",
		"  Inscribed upon her body, her Magic Crest was magecraft given physical form. It did not, however, stop with simply skin and flesh. It burrowed to the very marrow of her bones.",
		"\"Grrr.... GAHAH!\"",
		"  A playful smile graced her lips.",
		"  Her sense of reason had been turned upside-down by the pain.",
		"  That was only natural.",
		"(Huh. I can do this!)",
		"  She had to praise her own body for holding out so long while pushed beyond its limits.",
		"  The skull face noticed the abnormality.",
		"  It finally recognized the challenge for dominance over this space.",
		"  It laughed at the conceit it faced.",
		"  Never did it expect a Magician to challenge the great Flat Snark, lord of vessels over a millennium, and in such an age of decline!",
		"\"Hrrrgh... UGH!\"",
		"  She tried to catch her breath.",
		"  She braced herself for the coming pain.",
		"  She was going to smash that ice to pieces.",
		"  Both had access to the same amount of magical energy.",
		"  One of them was greatly outmatched, but...",
		"(There was a difference in our output. If I'm losing because of the scale of energy absorption and the size of the barrel, then...",
		"  The solution is simple. All I need to do is make the formula bigger, and me with it!)",
		"\"<Reconnect bullet configuration!|Change Tour Plan!>\"",
		"  The feedback would go beyond anything she had experienced to date.",
		"  Quite simply, her decision went beyond recklessness.",
		"  She expanded both formulae to maximum size.",
		"  The first layer would transform into a giant vortex, swallowing up the mist.",
		"  The second layer would process it from one end and pump it into her, the barrel.",
		"\"...I was naïve,",
		"  Thinking I could do something cute like shoot it down.",
		"  I need to blast it to hell!\"",
		"  The primeval magical energy responded in concert with her conviction.",
		"  It formed the pattern of a writhing serpent.",
		"  Voiceless magical power flying the banner of revolution.",
		"  She beckoned the great power of old to feast its eyes upon the land.",
		"  For it was the first of the trailblazers.",
		"  The representative of a mankind that knew no fear and would rend all manner of mythic and mystic to naught.",
		"\"I'm done borrowing from you, you lying boojum.",
		"  If you really want it, I'm more than happy to give it all back!\"",
		"  For the newest Magician commanded the principles of consumption and extinction!",
		"  An aberrant bullet of light melted through the castle of ice.",
		"  Her barrel was tempered.",
		"  Her control of magical energy was divine.",
		"  Her veins, totaling a hundred thousand kilometers in length, or two and a half times the circumference of the equator, accepted the flow of magical energy with avarice. The subsequent magic bullet swiftly flew straight into the moon.",
		"  NO NO NO NO!",
		"  Death rose to the surface of the moon.",
		"  A cry of terror, of indignation, echoed through the abandoned park.",
		"  Reality was burned into the eyes of this creature of fantasy.",
		"\"...Hah.\"",
		"  As Aoko looked upon its vain attempt to struggle, she knew she had tasted victory.",
		"  Victory despite her absolute reckless use of magical energy.",
		"  The energy scales had been tipped to their breaking point but nevertheless in her favor.",
		"\"<Bullet configuration...|Tour Plan...>\"",
		"\"<Total eclipse, converge!|Blacklight, Starbow!>",
		"  Tear it a new one!\"",
		"  Shatter. Shatter. Shatter. Shatter.",
		"  The skyscraper scattered into atomized dust.",
		"  The island, its unattainability extolled, had swallowed whole the despair of its many challengers.",
		"  And that which remained of this once proud thing that boasted of its untouched knowledge?",
		"  Azure mist bemoaned its demise.",
		"  The ice canopy in the sky crumbled.",
		"  The Snark-hunting bullet jumped over the moon.",
		"  Its throes of death sounded like the roaring sea, reverberating across this fairy-tale land.",
		"  The battle was over.",
		"  The thick fog dissipated, and the shattered ice melted away before it hit the ground.",
		"  A lethal bullet had topped the night king along with his throne, affording him no time to grieve his loss.",
		"  The Oil of the Moon.",
		"  The Untouched―Flat Snark.",
		"  The dreamscape that had begun with its resurrection ended with its demise, drawing a close to this nightmare."
