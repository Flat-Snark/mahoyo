		"　チ、チチチ、チ！",
		"　高度を落として主人の視界に入るなり、かん高く鳴く青い鳥。",
		"　その報告を、少女は無表情で聞いている。",
		"「……かまわないわ、予想通りよ。",
		"　撃つ事、壊す事しか能がなくても、青子の魔力の使い方は並じゃないから。急造の使い魔じゃ、まだ相手にはならないでしょう」",
		"　チチチ、と羽をすくめる駒鳥。",
		"　青子を<誉|ほ>める有珠を批難しているのか、",
		"　有珠に誉められる青子に嫉妬しているのか。",
		"　主人である有珠にも、いまいち読み取れない鳴き声である。",
		"　蒼崎青子は半人前の魔術師だ。",
		"　二年前まで魔術とは無関係に育ってきた少女で、生まれた時から魔女として育った有珠とは素質も経験も違いすぎる。",
		"　本来なら相手にすらしない次元。",
		"　魔術の腕を競うなら十回中十回、有珠に軍配があがるだろう。",
		"　けれど、こと戦い、殺し合いなら話は別だ。",
		"　久遠寺有珠は戦闘向きの魔術師ではなく、",
		"　蒼崎青子は戦いに特化した壊し屋である。",
		"　純粋な魔力勝負では青子の方が上だろう、と有珠は認めてさえいる。",
		"　青子は魔力の使い方が抜群に上手い。",
		"　魔術回路の規模は有珠より小さいが、回路の回転の速さ、その耐久構造、魔力の質、燃費の良さが並はずれている。",
		"　それが蒼崎青子の特性だ。",
		"　高度な魔術式は凡百に落ちるが、",
		"　魔力を流動させるだけの単純な魔術式なら、わずか二年の実践で有珠を上回っている。",
		"　……天才的なノリの良さと勘の良さ。",
		"　彼女の魔術行使は強いのではなく、おそろしく“速い”のだ。",
		"　蒼崎の家になんて生まれなければ、天才的な射撃手として名を<馳|は>せたに違いない。",
		"「でも、残念ね」",
		"　正面から撃ちあえば有珠に勝ち目はない。",
		"　否、そもそも魔弾などという原始的な魔術を、久遠寺有珠は習得していない。",
		"　彼女は典型的な人形師。",
		"　戦闘はすべて、手足となる使い魔が行うことだ。",
		"「……制限時間には気づいているわよね青子。",
		"　魔力はいくらでも貸してあげるけど―――貴女の魔弾は、あと半刻で<値崩|ねくず>れするわ」",
		"　チチチ、と<頷|うなず>くようにさえずって飛び立つ駒鳥。",
		"　遊園地が少女の支配下に<陥|おちい>ってからじき十分。",
		"　<緑|みどり>色の霧が何を生み出すものなのか。",
		"　地上を走る青子たちも、そろそろ事の深刻さに気が付く頃だった。"

		"  The moment the blue bird descended into its master's field of vision it made its high-pitched call.",
		"  The girl listened expressionlessly to the report.",
		"\"...No matter. Everything is going as  expected.",
		"  Even if she only knows how to shoot and destroy, the way Aoko uses magical energy is extraordinary. Hastily-formed familiars are no match for her.\"",
		"  The robin flapped its wings as it tweeted in response.",
		"  Perhaps it was criticizing Alice for complimenting Aoko.",
		"  Or perhaps it was jealous of Aoko for being complimented by Alice.",
		"  Alice could barely make sense of its chirping rant.",
		"  Aoko Aozaki was a novice mage.",
		"  Until just two years ago, she was someone who grew up with no background in magecraft. Compared to Alice, who was raised as a witch from birth, Aoko possessed far less talent and experience.",
		"  Winning was an impossibility for Aoko.",
		"  In a contest of skills in magecraft, ten times out of ten, Alice would be declared the victor.",
		"  However, a battle to the death was a different story.",
		"  Alice Kuonji was not a mage suited for battle.",
		"  Aoko Aozaki, on the other hand, was built for it.",
		"  In a contest that pitted magical energy against magical energy, even Alice would concede that Aoko had the upper hand.",
		"  Aoko's manipulation of magical energy was extraordinary.",
		"  The scale of her Magic Circuits was smaller than that of Alice's, but their rotational speed, durability, and quality of magical energy produced, not to mention the efficiency, were otherworldly.",
		"  That was Aoko Aozaki's hallmark.",
		"  Though she had many failings when handling sophisticated formulae,",
		"  in just two years of practice Aoko had surpassed Alice in simple formulae that merely required an energy input.",
		"  She also had genius-level instincts and adaptability.",
		"  Though Aoko was not particularly proficient at executing magecraft, she was terrifyingly fast.",
		"  If she had been born outside the Aozaki clan, she would have doubtless risen to fame as a competitive sharpshooter.",
		"\"What a pity.\"",
		"  In a straight shootout, Alice did not stand a chance.",
		"  Alice Kuonji had never bothered to learn primitive magecraft like magic bullets in the first place.",
		"  She was the classic puppeteer.",
		"  Her familiars would carry out all the particulars of battle as her arms and legs.",
		"\"Clock's ticking, Aoko.",
		"  I'm happy to lend you all the magical energy you like, but after an hour, those bullets will be worthless.\"",
		"  Chirping as if in agreement, the robin took flight.",
		"  It had been nearly ten minutes since Alice had made the amusement park into her dominion.",
		"  To what would the green fog give birth next?",
		"  Aoko and Soujuurou, still running about, would soon come to understand the gravity of their situation."
