		"「―――うわ。さすがに、無茶だわ」",
		"　青子は倒れたまま夜空を見上げている。",
		"　体はもう指一本だって動かない。",
		"　なんとか体を起こそうと力を入れてみたが、どこもかしこも悲鳴をあげている。",
		"　魔力はすっからかんで、魔術刻印も停止していた。",
		"　体力の回復……もとい、身体機能の完全回復には丸一日を要するだろう。",
		"　情けない話だが、今は呼吸だけで精一杯。",
		"　反面、胸はかつてない達成感に満ちていた。",
		"　なにしろ、あの“童話の怪物”のうち一体を真っ向から撃ち壊したのだ。",
		"　自分に有利な状況が続いただけ、とも言えるが、手も足もでなかった半年前に比べれば格段の進歩である。",
		"“……それはそれとして、有珠には<謝|あやま>っとかないと。",
		"　プロイって、壊したらそれっきりだものね”",
		"　そう。フラットスナークはもう二度と現れない。",
		"　ロンドンの協会に売り出せば値の付かない超稀少品、",
		"　魔術世界の財産とまで言われる秘術を、青子は跡形もなくブッ壊してしまったのだ。",
		"　なんというか、その場のノリと勢いで。",
		"“まあ、でも―――”",
		"　お互い納得ずくの戦いだったから、有珠は文句ひとつ言わないだろう。",
		"　内心では不満いっぱいと思われるが、あの少女はそういう、自らの品格を落とす真似はしないのだ。",
		"「っ―――」",
		"　安心から気が緩み、積み重なった疲労がなだれこむ。",
		"　失神じみた眠気を青子は理性で押しとどめた。",
		"　体の中は細かい傷だらけだが、奇跡的に外傷はない。このまま<十分|じゅっぷん>も休んでいれば立ち上がる事ぐらいはできそうだ。",
		"　夜空には、いまだ炎上する黄金の月。",
		"“正体は油だものね。そりゃあ、いつまでも燃え―――”",
		"　<漠然|ばくぜん>と空を見ていた目が、<愕然|がくぜん>とした空白に切り替わる。",
		"　彼女は指一本動かない状態で、",
		"“……そっか。スナークを見つけたベイカーも、最後はいっしょに消えるんだっけ―――”",
		"　あーあ、と。",
		"　最後の反撃で燃え尽きる、十秒後の<自分|みらい>を受け入れた。",
		"　―――一方、そのちょっと前。",
		"　強風<荒|すさ>ぶ<鉄骨橋|コースター>の上で、難しい顔のまま、彼は地上に目をこらしていた。",
		"「―――むむ？」",
		"　こぼれた呟きはこの上なく頼りない。",
		"　彼の視線の先。地上ではクリーチャーたちの目を盗んで地面に図形を刻んでいる青子の姿と―――",
		"「……なんだアレ。いくらなんでも頑丈すぎないか？」",
		"　そのずっと向こう。",
		"　倒壊したミラーハウスの方角に、何か、見覚えのあるモノを見た気がした。",
		"　草十郎の役割……地上六十メートルの高みから青子の髪を投げる、という仕事は終わっている。",
		"　派手さこそないが、掛け値無しで命がけの難行だった。",
		"　さらに付け加えるのなら、この後どうやって下りるのかを考えるだけで目眩がする。",
		"　これ以上の厄介事なんて、とてもじゃないが頷けない。",
		"「―――いや、でも、アレ―――」",
		"　ぐらぐら揺れる橋の上で、わたわたと取り乱す。",
		"　空には前触れなく現れた髑髏の面。",
		"　地上にはぐるんぐるん回転している青い光と、その中心にいる蒼崎青子。",
		"　……そしてもう一つ。",
		"　この位置にいる草十郎にしか知り得ないヒト影が、月に挑む青子へと迫っていた。",
		"　その影には下半身がない。",
		"　上半身だけの体で、ずるずると青子に近づいている。",
		"　距離的にはあと二百メートルほど。",
		"　不運な事に、青子の背後から<這|・><っ|・><て|・><き|・><て|・>いるため、彼女はその影に気付けない。",
		"「―――遠くて見えないけど、アレは―――」",
		"　間違いない。",
		"　この遊園地において、草十郎ではなく青子を狙うのは<あ|・><の|・><人|・><形|・>だけなのだから。",
		"「いや、でも。ほら、あるいは、ひょっとして―――",
		"　ただの偶然、ではないだろうか」",
		"　幾重にも交錯し、混乱する思考。",
		"　それも無理からぬ事だろう。",
		"　膨張した月と<光弾|ビーム>を撃ちまくってる少女、という状況だけで、草十郎的には目を疑う状況なのだ。",
		"「うわぁ……！」",
		"　青子の容赦のない超距離魔弾は、嵐のようにコースターを揺さぶっていく。",
		"　立っているだけで振り落とされ、転落死しかねない。",
		"　とにかく、この状況は草十郎には難しすぎる。",
		"　ここからコースターの入り口まで戻って青子に注意を<促|うなが>しに行くか？",
		"　いや、間に合うハズもなし、駆け下りたところで入り口には大量の焼きたてパンがいる。",
		"　そもそも青子は人形に気付いていて、近づいたとたん一撃で倒す可能性もある。その場合、自慢じゃないが足を引っ張る自信すらある草十郎だった。",
		"「っ………………」",
		"　何を選んでも役に立てそうにない状況。",
		"　第一、危険なのは青子だけでなく、草十郎も窮地に立っている。",
		"『行きは良い良い帰りは怖い』",
		"　帰り道に鬼が待っているのは都会であろうと山奥であろうと同じこと。",
		"　この道は特に顕著だ。行きはもちろん、帰り道も危険すぎる。",
		"<他|ひ><人|と>の事を心配する余裕はどこにもない。",
		"　地上六十メートルの死の淵にいる事を忘れるな、と草十郎は震える足に言い聞かせる。",
		"“……大丈夫、それは分かっている。けど―――”",
		"　キリキリと頭が痛む。",
		"　無謀である事も、馬鹿げた事なのも分かっている。",
		"山奥育ちの彼は、都会の誰よりも危険に関して敏感で、これからするコトを考えるだけで緊張で喉が嗄れきってしまう。",
		"　が、そんな草十郎でもはっきりと言えることは、",
		"「蒼崎のことだ、アレにぜったい気付いていない……！」",
		"　<半|なか>ば泣くような声をあげて、草十郎は高さ六十メートルの鉄骨を駆け下りだした。",
		"「はっ、はっ、はぁ、はっ―――！」",
		"　死の道行きを加速する。",
		"　加速するつもりはなくとも、下り坂である以上スピードは増していく。",
		"「っ、この、はっ、よっと―――！」",
		"　が、後悔はもう遅い。走りだしたのならもっと早く。",
		"なにしろホントに時間がない、今から全力で下りても間に合わない、ああでもそれより、コースターの出口にはブレッドマンたちで混雑中、",
		"となれば遅いも早いも結果は同じ、どのみち出口が塞がっている。急げ急げと必死になって、一歩ごとに落ちかける必要性とかまったくない……！",
		"「っ、だから！？」",
		"　それがどうしたと。",
		"　ごちゃついた<煩悶|はんもん>を、彼は一太刀で切り払った。",
		"　自分にできる事は足下に意識を集中して、一秒でも早く駆け下りるだけ。",
		"“間違えるな。いま大事なのは、間に合うとか助けられるとか、そういう結果の話じゃなくて―――”",
		"　ある衝動が、縮こまった手足を駆動させる。",
		"　渇ききった喉を、冷め切った<理屈|こころ>を、草十郎は“思いつき”だけで心の端っこに蹴り飛ばす。",
		"　根が単純な人間の面目躍如、とにかく難しいコトは終わってから考える―――！",
		"　だが、障害は縮こまる自分だけではない。",
		"「こんな時に―――！」",
		"　レールに集中していなければ落ちる状況で、最悪の邪魔者が出現する。",
		"「！」",
		"　一見いままで通りの卵に違和感を覚える草十郎。",
		"　何が変わっているのか。",
		"　その変化に気付いた瞬間、",
		"「って、よそ見してる場合じゃない……！」",
		"　踏み<外|はず>しかけた足を本能で持ち直す。",
		"　まだ落ちていない事が奇跡だった。",
		"　コースターを駆け下りるのは自殺行為そのものだった。",
		"　卵はぴったりと並走し、隙あらば体当たりでもしてきそうな<剣呑|けんのん>さ。",
		"オマケにあまり直視したくないが、内部に作られた扉らしき飾りが、少しずつ開こうとしているのも気になりすぎる。",
		"「ああもう、畜生！　なんだって、こんな―――！」",
		"　あまりにもどん詰まりな状況に悪態をつく。",
		"　それでも足は緩めない。",
		"むしろ速度をより増して、彼は並走する卵を睨みつける。",
		"「ハ―――ほんと、おかしい。",
		"　こんな状況なのに、何で―――」",
		"　自分は笑っているのだろう、と草十郎は不思議に思った。",
		"　青子のおまじないとやらの効果……なのかどうか、草十郎には判別できない。",
		"　彼女の指の感触は、まだ肌に残っている。",
		"　向けられた信頼も期待も、しっかりと胸に<覚|おぼ>えている。",
		"　……けれど、この衝動はそれらとは違うものだ。",
		"　この高揚は、もっと深層にある問題。",
		"　今の彼には分からない、いずれ向き合う事になる、埋められるべきがらんどう。",
		"「よし―――距離は、今なら二メートル、弱……！」",
		"　死のレールを走りながら、草十郎は正確に距離を<測|はか>る。",
		"　何との？",
		"　言うまでもない。この状況でたったひとつ、死の結末を飛び越える大一番との。",
		"「はっ―――はっ、はっは、はっ！」",
		"　乱れる呼吸に合わせて、“行くぞ、行くぞ”とハッパをかける。",
		"　本当にありえない。",
		"　自分は馬鹿げた事をしようとしている。",
		"　でも<そ|・><う|・><し|・><な|・><け|・><れ|・><ば|・><間|・><に|・><合|・><わ|・><な|・><い|・>、と気付いたのだからしようがない！",
		"「ほんと―――なんで、そこまでやるんだ！？」",
		"　今さらな自問自答を、彼は鼻で笑った。",
		"　一時的な混乱。極限状態における精神の高揚が、彼の心を裸にする。",
		"　大事なものは何なのか。",
		"　そんなもの、シンプルな彼には考えるまでもない。",
		"　成功も報酬も、原始の心には美味しそうには映らない。",
		"　彼は、ただ、",
		"“よし―――”",
		"　これはただ、そうありたいと望んだだけの話。",
		"　周りから強制された義務ではなく。",
		"　ただ純粋に、そういう風に生きたいと信じた、愚直な自己の欲望そのもので―――",
		"“行こう！”",
		"『！？』",
		"　卵に発声機能があったのなら、そう驚いたに違いない。",
		"　逃げるだけだった少年は、自分から大きく足を踏み外したのだ。",
		"　足は内ではなく、外に向かって。",
		"　レールの端で、勢いを殺さないようわずかに膝を曲げ、浮遊する卵を凝視し―――",
		"“やれる―――距離的に問題はない！”",
		"　夜を駆ける。",
		"　わずか１．５秒の夜間飛行。",
		"　地上三十メートルの、<紐|ひも>なし<縄|なわ>なしバンジージャンプ。",
		"　その落下先は―――",
		"　唯一の足場となる、空飛ぶ巨大な卵だった。",
		"「う、ひゃああーーーー！」",
		"　悲鳴のような、歓声のような声をあげながら、草十郎は必死に卵の表面にしがみつく。",
		"　……ほんの少し前。",
		"　恐怖心が無ければビルの上も平均台も変わらない、と血も涙もない魔女は言った。",
		"　その魔女とて、この光景を見たら言葉を失っただろう。",
		"　いくら恐怖心が無いと言っても、無茶と無謀は別の物だ。",
		"　あまつさえ、<こ|・><の|・><後|・>の行為に至っては、後日本気で頭にきた程である。",
		"「頼むぞ、卵！」",
		"　卵にしがみついたまま、<卵|・><か|・><ら|・><視|・><線|・><を|・><切|・><る|・>。",
		"　急速な落下感覚。",
		"　草十郎は薄目で風景を確認しながら、残り一メートル付近で視線を戻し、卵を視界に<納|おさ>めながら飛びだした。",
		"　―――いや、まことに信じがたい話ではあるが。",
		"　彼にとってはデパートのエレベーターも、",
		"　不思議動力で浮遊する卵も、",
		"　そう大差のない「移動道具」に見えたのである……！",
		"「よし、割れてない！",
		"食べ物を粗末にするのはよくないと思う！」",
		"　着地したのは小広場の近く。",
		"　命を投げたショートカットは、これ以上ないカタチで実を結んだ。",
		"　草十郎は着地しながら、止まる事なく走りだす。",
		"　彼の脳裏にあるのは青子に迫る人形の姿だけ。",
		"　なので、空から降ってくる月の光も、",
		"　利用された怒りに燃えて自ら破裂し、破片をまき散らさんとする卵も視界に映らない。",
		"「蒼崎―――！」",
		"「なぬ―――？」",
		"　目を疑う青子の表情が、最後の一足に力を入れる。",
		"　<詩篇|のろい>が展開する。",
		"　もはや逃がさぬと中身のない卵は<謳|うた>い―――",
		"　カオスに散らかる卵の断片。",
		"　ダンプティに刻まれた“女王アリスを讃える唄”は、急速に五感を奪っていく。",
		"「っ―――それは、それとして―――」",
		"　途切れていく感覚に<喝|かつ>を入れて、草十郎は横たわる青子に走り寄る。",
		"　足は止まらない。",
		"そもそも感覚がないので自らの意志で止める事さえできず、",
		"「<人形|おまえ>、驚くほどしつこいぞ……！」",
		"　<交差点|スクランブル>の<爆発|マーダー><事故|ケース>。",
		"　三者三様の残骸が、閃光弾となって地上に咲く。",
		"　……敗者たちがこぞって潰しあった最終幕。",
		"　久遠寺有珠が見ていたら頭を抱えそうな結末から、ふたりは間一髪ではじき出された。",
		"　この、世にも<希|まれ>なつぶし合いを冷静に把握できたのは、助けられた少女だけ。",
		"　走り続けた少年は背後の結末にあまり関心もなく、",
		"「はあ―――死ぬかと、思った」",
		"　自分のしでかした奇跡より、抱きかかえた少女の無事を確かめて、安堵の息を漏らしていた。",
		"　……かくして、夜明けを待たず月は落ちた。",
		"　御伽の国の<装飾|テクスチャ>が溶けていく。",
		"　道に響いていた華やかな<旋律|コード>も、",
		"　来客を歓迎する<人形|パペット>たちの姿も、",
		"　すべて幻となって、本来のカタチに戻っていく。",
		"　<密|ひそ>やかに、<静|しず>やかに。",
		"　もう二度と目覚める事のない、忘却の国に沈んでいく。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　一夜の夢の名残火。",
		"　遊園地を照らす数多の<電飾|ライト>も、ひとつずつ消えていく。",
		"　その光景をふたりは眺めていた。",
		"　草十郎は地面に倒れこんで、必死に酸素を取りこんでいる。",
		"　爆弾卵の<詩篇|のろい>で痛覚は麻痺し、積み重なった疲労は相当なものだろう。吹けば消えそうとはこの事だ。",
		"　一方の青子も疲れきってはいたが、草十郎ほど息の乱れはない。",
		"今は深呼吸を繰り返し、体力回復に努めている。",
		"「……あのさ」",
		"　青子は視線を遊園地に向けたまま、関心のない素振りで、草十郎に声をかけた。",
		"　やや芝居がかった唐突さ。本当は面と向かって話しかけたいのを、意地で堪えているのが見え見えである。",
		"「……貴方、なんかすごいコトしなかった？」",
		"　……彼女が死を受け入れた、永遠とも言える一瞬。",
		"　月の破片に貫かれる自分を、冷静に、自分でもどうかと思うほど客観的に見ていた時。",
		"　力強く呼びかける声が、彼女を現実に引き戻した。",
		"　……いかなる理由で、何を考えて、どんな無茶をして、彼は自分を助けたのか。",
		"　倒れていた青子には、そのあたりの経緯がまったく分からない。確かなことは、最後の最後で、最高のフォローをしてもらったという事だけ。",
		"　それが知りたくて声をかけたが、それ以上のことは言葉にできない。",
		"　言葉にしたら負けな気がして、こんな風に、らしくない態度で声をかけたのだ。",
		"　もちろん幸い、話しかけられた彼には、そんな彼女のいじらしさに気付く余裕も情緒も、ありはしなかったのだが。",
		"「すごいって、",
		"それは、",
		"蒼崎の方、",
		"だろ」",
		"　草十郎は胸を弾ませながら答える。",
		"　今は肺に酸素を送るのに手一杯で、青子に顔を向ける余裕もない。",
		"「………………」",
		"　そんな様子を、少女は横目で観察する。",
		"　振り返れば、少年の役割はどれも同じだった。",
		"　鏡の城でも童話の遊園地でも、彼は自分の無力さを<嗤|わら>わず、自分にできる事と向きあい続けた。",
		"　相手を打ち負かしたのはいいものの、勢いあまって転びかけた愚か者とは大違いだ。",
		"　…………だから今の無謀だって、彼にすればそう特別な事ではなく、",
		"『―――提案。あいつをやっつけるのに協力したら、俺の事は見逃してくれる？』",
		"　せめて、自分に出来る事からは目を背けない彼にとっての、<精一杯|できるかぎり>の勇気だった。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　観客から見ればただの脇役。",
		"　目の覚めるような活躍だなんてとても言えない。",
		"　けれど、転ばないよう手を引っ張られた少女にすれば話は別で、",
		"“……まあね。",
		"　認めたくないし、口になんて、もっとしたくないけど”",
		"　少年の<奮起|ふんき>は脇役扱いされるものではなく。",
		"　本当にすごい事をしたのはコイツだよ、なんて、まわりに言い聞かせたいほどの奮戦だったのだ。",
		"「――――――はあ」",
		"「蒼崎？」",
		"“……ホント。人畜無害も、度を過ぎると侮れないわ”",
		"　はあ、と青子は自分自身にため息をつく。",
		"　けれど仕方がない。たったいま窮地から救ってくれた姿は、ほんのちょっとだけ格好良かったし、",
		"「……ま。評価、甘めだけど」",
		"　正直。こんなのにわざわざ手を下すなんて、<莫|ば><迦|か>らしいにも程がある。",
		"　呼吸を整え、少女はすぅ、と体を起こした。",
		"　……実のところまだ厳しいが、彼女にも魔術師としての誇りがある。",
		"　なので、<宣言|せんげん>する時は<威厳|いげん>がなくてはいけないのだ。",
		"「静希君。見逃すのは今日だけって話だったけど、アレ、なしでいいわ。",
		"とりあえず、命は助けてあげるから」",
		"　仕方なさげに差し出される右手。",
		"　握手とも、座りこんだ草十郎を立ち上がらせる為のものとも取れる。",
		"　一方。",
		"　差し出された手を取らず、草十郎は自分の足で立ち上がった。",
		"　この夜。",
		"散々な目にあわされながらも、結局一度も見せなかった、心から意外そうな<表|か><情|お>をして。",
		"「な、なによそのリアクションは」",
		"　何か、とんでもなく恥ずかしい事をした気になって言い<淀|よど>む青子。",
		"　そんな彼女を、草十郎はまじまじと見つめている。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　……問題は。",
		"じろじろと見つめられれば不快になる筈なのに、嫌悪感がまったくないこと。",
		"　むしろ容認しちゃってもいいかも知れない、などと、青子をして思わせるほど温かみのある視線で―――",
		"「いや、そんなお友達感覚の話じゃなくてだな。そういう好き嫌いじゃなくて、草の字は本気でおまえに―――」",
		"“……あ……”",
		"　そこで。",
		"　よせばいいのに、忘れていた台詞を思い出した。",
		"“いかん、それは違う！”",
		"　鳶丸の台詞を心の中で思いっきり否定して、青子は草十郎に向き直る。",
		"「そ、それとこれは別だから！",
		"　私はアンタの事とか、ホントどうでもいいんだから！」",
		"　はい？　と首を傾げる草十郎。",
		"「さっき嫌いだって言われたけど」",
		"　唐突な青子の発言に疑問こそあれ文句はなく、彼は淡々と言葉を返す。",
		"「う―――」",
		"　……たしかに、面と向かって言った。",
		"　けれどあれは言葉のアヤで、本気に取られると困ってしまうし、なによりそれより、今はそんな事を論じている場面ではなく、",
		"「そ、そうじゃなくて！　あなたが私に<惚|ほ>れてても、期待しないでって言ってるの！」",
		"　つまり彼女は、そういう事を論じたいらしい。",
		"　柄にもない事を怒鳴って、青子は<微|かす>かに赤面する。",
		"　なんでこんなコトを口にする羽目になったんだろう、と悩みながら。",
		"　……それでも、とにかく言いたい事、言うべき事は言ったのだ。",
		"　ここは礼儀として、相手の返答を待つだけである。",
		"“あなたとは付き合えない”",
		"　なんてハートブレイクな言葉を受けて、純朴な少年はこの世の終わりのように、がっくりと肩を落とし……",
		"　てはいなかった。",
		"　それどころか、なにやら真剣に考えこんでいる。",
		"「俺が、蒼崎に、惚れてるって……？」",
		"　呪文のように呟く草十郎。",
		"　そうよ、と突っ返す青子。",
		"　深く、返事を待つ青子がドギマギするぐらい深く考えこんだ末、少年は少女を見つめ返して、すっぱりと言った。",
		"「―――なんで？」",
		"　………冗談じゃ、",
		"ない。",
		"　彼は本気で言っている。",
		"“と―――”",
		"　つまり、好きではあるけど、好きなダケ。",
		"　ぜんぶ副会長の早とちり。色恋沙汰とか男女の浪漫とか、はじめっからあたまになし。",
		"“と、と、と―――”",
		"　まだ悩んでいる草十郎の仕草が、よけい恥ずかしい。",
		"　青子は顔どころか全身熱くなる衝動に襲われて、",
		"「むう。もう一度聞くけど、なんで？」",
		"「そりゃあ、こっちが聞きたいわよーーーー！！！！」",
		"“鳶丸の、大馬鹿野郎ーーーーーーっ！！！！！”",
		"　……このように。",
		"もはや<釈明|しゃくめい>のしようもない、あるまじき暴挙に出たのだった。",
		"　なんという現場封鎖、証拠隠滅。",
		"　恥ずかしさで頬が溶けるかのようなパニックと、鳶丸への恨みが彼女を突発的な犯行に走らせた。",
		"　飛ぶ鳥すら落とす正拳突き。もとい、やや弧を描いたのでストレートではなくフックと言うべきか。",
		"「あ…………」",
		"　会心の手応えに目を点にする青子。",
		"　無防備だった彼と、激情に乗り出した自分。",
		"　腰の入った一撃は、見事なまでに彼の意識を刈り取った。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　きゅう、と声をもらして倒れこむ草十郎。",
		"　受けたばかりの詩篇の呪いと、今の一撃がトドメになったらしい。",
		"　眠るように……と表現するにはやや苦しい、苦悶に歪んだ寝顔だが、これは気絶ではなく眠ったのだ、と青子は強引に解釈するコトにした。",
		"「……ま、いっか。予定通りになったものね」",
		"　うん、とノックダウンした草十郎を見て、青子は肩の力を抜いた。色々と邪魔が入ったけれど、とりあえずこれで一件落着だ。",
		"　虚勢を張る相手もいなくなると、どっと疲れがやってくる。",
		"「うわ……歩いて帰れるかな、私」",
		"　つい弱音をこぼすほどの疲労だった。",
		"　考えてみれば魔力を使いきったのも初めてだし、何の前準備もなしでこれだけの戦いをこなしたのも初めてだ。",
		"　いや、そもそも―――",
		"「私ひとりじゃ、どっちも相打ちだったっけ」",
		"　呟いた声は、どこか誇らしげだった。",
		"　本来なら<自戒|じかい>すべき事なのに、苦笑いしている自分にやれやれと肩をすくめる。",
		"　それもこれも、いま傍らで眠っている誰かさんのおかげだろう。",
		"「……ね、聞こえてないわよね？」",
		"　夜風よりも小さい呼びかけに、反応はない。",
		"　それに安心して、もっと小さい声で彼女は続ける。",
		"「……その、ありがと。",
		"十分に助けてもらったわ」",
		"　もちろん返事はないし、期待もしていない。たんに言っておきたかっただけだ。",
		"　少女はしばしうなされ眠る少年を眺めたあと、よし、と気持ちを入れ替えてポケットに手を伸ばした。",
		"　同居人にもらった、手のひらに納まりそうなガラスの瓶を取り出して、ポン、と開封する。",
		"「でも、それとこれとは別だから」",
		"　冬の夜風よりクールな一言を残して、彼女は彼の名前を呼びかけた。",
		"　返事もないのに、瓶はことり、と反応する。",
		"　横になっている少年の姿がぐにゃりと歪んだかと思うと、瓶の重さが少しだけ増した気がした。",
		"「うわ。どうなってんだろ、コレ」",
		"　<曇|くも>ったガラスごしには、たしかに人影のような形が見える。",
		"　久遠寺有珠の道具は、魔術師たちですら頭を悩ます神秘の具現だ。",
		"　理屈やら辻褄を合わせようとする時点で、<魔術師|あおこ>には手の届かない魔術である。",
		"　それに納得して瓶の蓋を閉めると、少年の姿は手品のようにかき消えた。",
		"「……まったく。こんなの手品じゃなくて魔法だって」",
		"　ひとり呟いて、青子は魔法の瓶を覗きこむ。",
		"　瓶の重さはさして変わらないし、どんな仕組みかも青子には分からない。けれどたしかに、人間ひとりが閉じこめられている。",
		"　その軽さは幻のようで、いまいち実感が湧かなかった。",
		"　人の重さというより風の重さだ。",
		"　夏の風を手探りで掻き集めて、この瓶に詰めこんだのなら、ちょうどこれぐらいの重さになるだろう。",
		"　だから彼女にとって、草十郎はそんなイメージなのだ。",
		"「……有珠の言う通り」",
		"　そんな事を考えてしまった自分を振り返って、ぼんやりと彼女は呟く。",
		"「ほんと、私らしくない」",
		"　いつもの不機嫌さではなく、微笑むように苦笑する。",
		"　世の中は広いのだし。ひとりぐらいは、ペースを乱す相手がいるのも、張り合いがあっていい。",
		"　苦笑しながら、一回だけこつん、と小さな魔法の瓶を指で弾くと、彼女は静かに歩きだした。",
		"　遠く、終演のベルが鳴る。",
		"　世は全て事もなく、うたかたの夢も元通り。",
		"　役者の去った遊園地は、静かに<装飾|あかり>を消していく。",
		"　……こうして。とうに寿命を迎えていた遊園地は少年と少女の思い出の地になって、その役割を終えたのだった。"

		"\"Ugh...\"",
		"  The second Aoko relaxed, her fatigue finally caught up with her.",
		"  She did everything in her power to fight off the overwhelming drowsiness.",
		"  Aside from a few minor internal injuries, her body was miraculously unscathed, so much so she felt that she could probably stand up and dust herself off after a bit of rest.",
		"  The golden moon continued to burn in the night sky.",
		"(Well, you are oil, after all. You could probably burn for―)",
		"  Aoko's bleary eyes went wide in astonishment.",
		"  She was still unable to lift a finger.",
		"(Oh, right. The Baker who found the Snark disappeared along with it...)",
		"  She sighed in resignation.",
		"  Aoko accepted that her final stand left her with only ten seconds before she burned to ash, too.",
		"  Elsewhere, just a short moment prior...",
		"  Buffeted by strong winds atop the roller coaster, Soujuurou gravely peered down at the ground.",
		"\"...Hmm?\"",
		"  All he could muster was a single murmur.",
		"  He could see Aoko on top of some drawing on the ground, and...",
		"\"...What in the world is that thing made of?\"",
		"  In the distance...",
		"  There was something familiar in the direction of the ruined house of mirrors.",
		"  Soujuurou's job―to throw Aoko's hair from a great height―was complete.",
		"  While not the most impressive of tasks, it was absolutely a matter of life-or-death.",
		"  And to top it all off, just thinking about how he was going to get back down to the ground was making him dizzy.",
		"  He had experienced more than enough trouble for one day.",
		"\"Wait, but...\"",
		"  He was flustered as he stood atop the swaying bridge.",
		"  A skull suddenly appeared in the sky above.",
		"  On the ground, he could see a circling blue light with Aoko Aozaki in the middle of it.",
		"  ...And one more thing.",
		"  A shadow was approaching Aoko that only someone from his vantage point could see.",
		"  A shadow missing the lower half of its body.",
		"  The upper half of its body was slowly clawing its way to Aoko.",
		"  They were still over two hundred meters apart.",
		"  Unfortunately for Aoko, she completely failed to notice it approaching from behind.",
		"\"It's too far away to make out, but...isn't that...\"",
		"  He was sure of what it was now.",
		"  There was only one thing in the park that would chase Aoko and not him: the puppet.",
		"\"But... I mean, maybe it's...",
		"  ...a coincidence, right?\"",
		"  His mind ran in circles.",
		"  It was a perfectly reasonable reaction.",
		"  Any grip on reality he might have had left was long lost when Aoko started firing beams of light at the monstrous moon.",
		"\"Whoa!\"",
		"  Aoko's merciless fire buffeted the roller coaster like a storm.",
		"  Just standing on it was almost enough for him to be thrown off and killed.",
		"  At any rate, Soujuurou couldn't fathom the situation.",
		"  Should he head back to the entrance of the roller coaster and warn Aoko about the incoming threat?",
		"  No, there was no way he would make it in time, and to make matters worse, there was a horde of bread down there, waiting for him.",
		"  And it may very well have been the case that Aoko was already aware of the puppet and would take it out as soon as it got closer. If she was, Soujuurou was sure he would only be in the way.",
		"\"But...\"",
		"  It did not seem like there was anything he could do to help.",
		"  And beyond that, Aoko was not the only one in danger. He was in quite the predicament himself.",
		"\"You can't go home again.\"",
		"  The road home was never as safe as one thought. It was as true here as it had been in the mountains.",
		"  The path he was on was no exception. As risky as the ascent had been, it was even more dangerous to go back down.",
		"This was no time to be worrying about others.",
		"  His shaking legs reminded him that only sixty meters separated him from death.",
		"(I'll be fine. I know that. Just...)",
		"  His head was pounding.",
		"  This was reckless and stupid.",
		"Having been raised in the mountains, he was more sensitive to danger than anyone raised in the city, and just thinking about what he was about to do made his throat seize up.",
		"  There was only one thing he could say for sure.",
		"\"Aozaki has no idea that thing is coming for her!\"",
		"  With a sobbing shout, Soujuurou started making his way down the sixty meter frame of the roller coaster.",
		"\"Hah... hah... hah... haaa!\"",
		"  His race toward death accelerated.",
		"  He never meant to speed up, but the downward slope propelled him forward.",
		"\"Here... I... go!\"",
		"  It was too late for regrets. Now that he was running, he had no choice but to go even faster.",
		"And time was not on his side. He never would have made it in time if he'd taken the long way down, never mind the bread-men crowding the exit of the roller coaster.",
		"With the exits blocked, the outcome would be the same whether he went slowly or quickly. There was no reason to rush to his death as desperately as he did!",
		"\"So what?!\"",
		"  So what if it was futile?",
		"  Soujuurou cleared the doubts from his mind.",
		"  He turned his attention to what he could do: keep his footing and try to arrive at the bottom as quickly as he could.",
		"(Focus! Forget whether you'll be there in time to save her! The most important thing is...)",
		"  He had no idea what impulses were driving his stiff limbs.",
		"  He just focused on the moment, pushing past the fear and the cold logic.",
		"  At his core, he was the kind of person to deal with problems head-on. There would be time to think about consequences later!",
		"  But, hesitation was not his only obstacle.",
		"\"Not now!\"",
		"  The worst possible hindrance appeared at a time when not focusing on the track would mean certain death.",
		"\"!\"",
		"  Soujuurou sensed something wrong with the egg he had been so studiously observing out of one eye.",
		"  Something had changed.",
		"  And at the very moment he realized it...",
		"\"I can't be looking to the side right now!\"",
		"  Soujuurou stumbled then instinctively caught himself.",
		"  It was a miracle he had not fallen.",
		"  Descending a roller coaster on foot was an act of suicide.",
		"  The egg stayed right by his side―so close it was likely it would collide with him.",
		"Though he was trying as hard as he could not to look at it, he could not help but feel unease that the door-like decoration in its center was gradually opening.",
		"\"Dammit! Why now?!\"",
		"  He cursed his rotten situation.",
		"  And yet, he refused to slow down.",
		"He ran even faster, glaring at the egg on his side.",
		"\"Hah... What the hell is going on.",
		"  Why? It has the worst timing!\"",
		"  Soujuurou was baffled to find that he was smiling.",
		"  Perhaps it had something to do with Aoko's charm. Soujuurou could not tell one way or the other.",
		"  He could still feel Aoko's fingers on his skin.",
		"  The trust and expectation she had placed in him was etched into his heart.",
		"  But what spurred him on was something entirely different.",
		"  This all stemmed from a much deeper problem.",
		"  It was something inside him that he could not understand at the time, but would eventually come to terms with one day.",
		"\"All right, less than two meters left!\"",
		"  He carefully judged the distance as he ran down the track of death.",
		"  But the distance between what?",
		"  That went without saying. It was the distance between himself and the one thing that could save his life.",
		"\"Hah... Hah! Haha! Hah...!\"",
		"  He told himself he was going to do it, over and over, like a mantra.",
		"  Soujuurou could not believe himself.",
		"  What he was about to do was incredibly stupid.",
		"  But what is stupid when smart is not an option?",
		"\"I'm really going to do this?! This is insane!\"",
		"  Amidst it all, he laughed at how pointless such self-reflection was now.",
		"  Temporary confusion, a psychological thrill ride; both had laid his soul bare.",
		"  What really mattered?",
		"  But a simple man gets by without deep thought.",
		"  Soujuurou's primitive mind did not crave success or reward.",
		"  For him it was simple.",
		"(This is it!)",
		"  He was doing it because he wanted to.",
		"  Not because he felt obliged to those around him.",
		"  His desire to live his way was his and his own.",
		"(Here we go!)",
		"\"?!\"",
		"  If the egg had been equipped with a vocal function, it would have gasped in shock at what happened next.",
		"  The boy, who had only tried to escape up until this point, suddenly shifted his weight.",
		"  He pointed his feet outward instead of inward.",
		"  On the edge of one rail, he crouched ever-so slightly to maintain momentum and gazed at the floating egg.",
		"Close enough! I can do this!",
		"  He soared through the night sky.",
		"  It was a flight that lasted a mere one and a half seconds.",
		"  A cordless bungee jump from thirty meters above ground.",
		"  His destination:",
		"  The only thing that would stop his fall―the giant flying egg.",
		"\"Hyaaah!\"",
		"  He shrieked, this time out of elation, as he desperately clung to the egg's surface.",
		"  Just earlier...",
		"  The cold-blooded witch had told him that without fear, the top of a building would feel no different than a balance beam.",
		"  This from the same witch that would have been left speechless had she witnessed this spectacle.",
		"  Fearlessness was one thing, recklessness was another.",
		"  He followed it up with an act that would irritate her for days to come.",
		"\"I'm relying on you, egg!\"",
		"  Clinging to the egg, he shifted his gaze away from it.",
		"  He felt the rapid descent.",
		"  Soujuurou, focusing his half-shut eyes on the ground, leaped off the egg once they were a one meter from the ground, then turned back to it, careful to reestablish eye contact.",
		"  Something so unbelievable, though to Soujuurou...",
		"  The elevator at the department store",
		"  and the mysterious floating egg were both just moving objects,",
		"  virtually indistinguishable from one another.",
		"\"All right! It didn't break!",
		"It's always a shame when food goes to waste!\"",
		"  He landed near the plaza.",
		"  The shortcut that almost cost him his life had paid off.",
		"  Soujuurou took off running the second his feet touched the ground.",
		"  The puppet after Aoko was the only thing on his mind.",
		"  He paid no mind to the moonlight in the sky.",
		"  Or the egg, furious about being used and seconds away from self-destructing and blasting fragments all over the place.",
		"\"Aozaki!\"",
		"\"Huh?\"",
		"  Aoko's dumbfounded expression spurred Soujuurou on.",
		"  The curse was complete.",
		"  The empty egg began to sing its warning to let them know there was no escape.",
		"  Shrapnel from the egg exploded through the air.",
		"  The \"Ode to Queen Alice\" that Alice had engraved into Dumpty quickly robbed him of his senses.",
		"\"Okay... Was that it?\"",
		"  He snapped back to the task at hand and ran to Aoko, still lying on the ground.",
		"  His legs ran of their own accord.",
		"Though he could not have ever stopped them anyway since he could no longer feel them.",
		"\"Don't you puppets ever give up?!\"",
		"  The Scrambled Murder Case.",
		"  Piles of rubble became flowers of light blooming from the earth.",
		"  The final curtain drew closed, and the defeated left the battleground.",
		"  Had Alice Kuonji seen it up close, it would have left her beside herself. The two had escaped by hair's breadth.",
		"  The only person in a position to witness that rare mutual destruction was the girl who had been saved from it.",
		"  The boy who had never stopped running paid it no mind.",
		"\"Phew. I thought you were a goner.\"",
		"  The safety of the girl in his arms meant infinitely more to him than the miraculous way in which he saved her.",
		"  ...The moon did not wait for dawn to set.",
		"  The ornamental texture of the fairy-tale kingdom faded away.",
		"  All of the illusions returned to the way they were before,",
		"  from the ostentatious chords reverberating through the streets,",
		"  to the puppets welcoming their guests.",
		"  Peace and quiet reigned once more",
		"  over a forgotten kingdom, never to be awakened again.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Out flickered the embers of a late-night dream...",
		"  ...even the electric lamps that illuminated the park.",
		"  Together, they watched it disappear.",
		"  Soujuurou lay on the ground, desperately gasping for air like a fish out of water.",
		"  The curse of the exploding egg had numbed his pain, and he was understandably exhausted after all he had experienced. He looked like he could be blown away by the lightest of breezes.",
		"  While Aoko was also exhausted, she was still in better shape.",
		"Focused on taking deep, even breaths, she was already working to recover her strength.",
		"\"...So.\"",
		"  She addressed Soujuurou indifferently as her gaze remained on the amusement park.",
		"  The abruptness of it was a bit theatrical in nature. She wanted to look at him as she spoke, but her pride was simply too great.",
		"\"...You did something kinda amazing, didn't you?\"",
		"  The moment she had accepted death had seemed like an eternity.",
		"  She was beside herself in shock at how indifferent she had been as the shards rained down from the moon.",
		"  But a reassuring voice had snapped her back into reality.",
		"  Why did he do it? What was he thinking? What moronic things did he have to do to pull it off?",
		"  She had no answers for these questions, lying on the ground as she was. All she knew was that he had more than made up for his failure in the house of mirrors and then some, in those fateful final moments.",
		"  She addressed him hoping to find answers, but found herself unable to probe any further.",
		"  To dig any deeper would feel like defeat, which is why it was so unlike her to ask him in the first place.",
		"  Lucky for her, Soujuurou had neither the capacity nor sensitivity to understand how egocentric she was being.",
		"\"Amazing?",
		" You were...",
		"...pretty amazing...",
		"...Aozaki.\"",
		"  He stuttered between labored breaths.",
		"  It was taking him so much effort just to breathe that he could not address her properly.",
		"\"....\"",
		"  She watched him out of the corner of her eye.",
		"  Thinking back on it, the boy had performed the same role each time.",
		"  Each and every time, he did what he could in spite of his fecklessness.",
		"  It was far more admirable than her nearly suicidal tactics, even if she did defeat her opponent.",
		"  He did not even recognize how extraordinary his last act of courage was.",
		"\"Here's an idea. If I help you kill that thing, will you let me go?\"",
		"  At the very least, he had the courage to keep trying whatever he could.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  A spectator might have viewed him as a supporting actor.",
		"  His actions were not exactly memorable.",
		"  But the lead actress he supported did not see it that way.",
		"(Well...",
		"  I don't really want to admit it to myself, much less say it out loud, but...)",
		"  Such inspired actions were wasted in a supporting role.",
		"  This guy really pulled off the impossible. It was so amazing that she wanted to shout it as loud as she possibly could for all the world to hear.",
		"\"...Hah.\"",
		"\"Aozaki?\"",
		"(God. He's so innocent it makes me want to barf.)",
		"  All Aoko could do was sigh.",
		"  How could she not? Even she was forced to admit that the way he'd snatched her from the jaws of death was... dashing.",
		"\"I must be getting soft.\"",
		"  Truth be told, he was a lunatic for doing what he did.",
		"  She steadied her breathing and composed herself.",
		"  She was in bad shape, and she had her pride as a mage to consider.",
		"  Which was why she needed to maintain an air of dignity when making a proclamation.",
		"\"Shizuki, I originally meant to let you off the hook for today only, but I'm willing to let the whole thing go.",
		"For the time being, I've decided to let you live.\"",
		"  She hastily extended her right hand.",
		"  It was either to shake his or to help him up.",
		"  However...",
		"  Soujuurou did not take her hand, but instead stood up on his own.",
		"  This night.",
		"Despite the sheer insanity that he had just experienced, his face had not once looked as incredulous as it did now.",
		"\"W-What? Something wrong?\"",
		"  She stammered, worried that she had deeply embarrassed herself.",
		"  Soujuurou's gaze was fixed upon Aoko.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  A problem had dawned on Aoko.",
		"Though she normally hated being stared at, this time, she did not mind.",
		"  Rather, she was enjoying the warmth in his eyes and felt like it was something she could almost come to appreciate.",
		"\"Don't you get it? This isn't just about friendship! And I didn't mean he only 'likes' you, either! Believe me when I say that Sono-G really-\"",
		"(Oh no...)",
		"  The conversation came rushing back.",
		"  It was a memory better left forgotten.",
		"(No, not happening!)",
		"  Pushing Tobimaru's words out of her mind, Aoko turned to Soujuurou.",
		"\"D-Don't get any ideas!",
		"  I don't care about you in the least!\"",
		"  Puzzled, Soujuurou tilted his head.",
		"\"You already told me how much you dislike me.\"",
		"  He responded matter-of-factly to her sudden declaration.",
		"\"Uuuh...\"",
		"  She certainly had pointed that out. And to his face no less.",
		"  It had a mere figure of speech that he was not meant to take literally, but now was not the time to belabor the point.",
		"\"I-I'm not talking about that! I'm just saying... you shouldn't get your hopes up, no matter how far you've fallen for me!\"",
		"  Yet, belabor she did anyway.",
		"  Aoko blushed slightly, realizing how inane she was being.",
		"  She wondered how she'd ended up in this position.",
		"  And yet, she knew that she had to get this off her chest.",
		"  All that was left was to politely wait for his response.",
		"\"I can't date you.\"",
		"  Such heartbreakingly painful words were too much for the simple boy to hear. His shoulders slumped as if the world was coming to an end―",
		"  Or so Aoko thought.",
		"  On the contrary, Soujuurou was sitting there in deep thought.",
		"\"Did you just say... I'm in love with you?\"",
		"  Soujuurou murmured the words as if they were a magic spell.",
		"  She shot right back with the affirmative.",
		"  After a moment of deep contemplation, the boy turned to the expectant girl, and said,",
		"\"Why do you think that?\"",
		"  He had to be joking.",
		" But he was not.",
		"  He was completely serious.",
		"(So...)",
		"  He liked her, but he didn't LIKE like her.",
		"  Of course the vice-president had jumped to conclusions. This boy had no interest in romance. He probably didn't even know what that was.",
		"(So... So... So...)",
		"  She was incredibly embarrassed by how confused Soujuurou still appeared to be.",
		"  Her rosy complexion spread throughout her entire body.",
		"\"Umm... I'll ask again, but why do you think that?\"",
		"\"THAT'S WHAT I WANNA KNOW!!!\"",
		"(You freaking moron, Tobimaru!!!)",
		"  Just like that...",
		"She had lost her cool and given in to an unjustifiable outburst.",
		"  It was time to seal off the area and destroy all evidence.",
		"  Aoko's embarrassment devolved into sheer panic, and her grudge against Tobimaru suddenly manifested as criminal assault.",
		"  She lashed out with a punch that could have taken down a bird mid-flight. More specifically, it was a brutal right hook.",
		"\"Oh.\"",
		"  Aoko blinked. Her blow had connected with something solid, snapping her out of her reverie.",
		"  Her temper had lashed out at the completely defenseless Soujuurou.",
		"  It had been a splendid blow with all her weight behind it, knocking him out cold.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou groaned, crumpling to the ground.",
		"  Her punch finished the job that the curse had started.",
		"  If not for the discomfort on his face, he appeared almost to be sleeping. Aoko convinced herself that he was napping, not concussed.",
		"\"...Well, whatever. It was always going to end like this anyway.\"",
		"  The tension in her shoulders eased away as she looked down at Soujuurou. A ton had gotten in her way over the course of today, but the day was saved, for now.",
		"  With nobody left to butt heads, she felt exhaustion finally overtake her.",
		"\"Ugh... How the heck am I going to walk home like this?\"",
		"  Her fatigue was enough to make her complain out loud.",
		"  When she thought about it, she realized that this was the first time she had used up all of her magical energy and the first time she had participated in a battle of this scale without any prior preparation.",
		"  Though in truth...",
		"\"It would have ended in mutual destruction if I'd been alone.\"",
		"  She felt somewhat proud as she whispered those words.",
		"  Normally, it was something that she would beat herself up over, but instead, she simply shrugged her shoulders with a bitter smile.",
		"  After all, it was thanks to the person sleeping by her side.",
		"\"...Hey. You can't hear me, can you?\"",
		"  As if the night had swallowed her voice before it reached him, she received no response.",
		"  Confident, she continued in an even quieter voice.",
		"\"So, uh, thank you.",
		" You really got me out of a jam, there.\"",
		"  Of course, there was no response from Soujuurou, and she was not expecting one. Saying it for the record was enough.",
		"  Aoko watched Soujuurou sleep for a while and then pulled something out of her pocket.",
		"  It was the palm-sized glass bottle her roommate had given her, which she opened with a pop.",
		"\"But none of this matters.\"",
		"  Leaving behind words colder than a winter chill at night, she called out his name.",
		"  She barely sensed the bottle moving.",
		"  As the silhouette of the fallen boy appeared to blur, she got the feeling that the weight of the bottle had increased slightly.",
		"\"Whoa. That's kind of weird.\"",
		"  What appeared to be a human form could clearly be seen inside the glass.",
		"  Alice Kuonji's tools were Mystics that confounded even the most knowledgeable of mages.",
		"  As soon as Aoko tried to analyze them with logic or reason, she was already out of her depth.",
		"  Knowing this all too well, Aoko closed the bottle and watched the boy disappear as if by some magic trick.",
		"\"Jeez. This is no stage trick. It's actual magic.\"",
		"  She muttered as she looked into the magical bottle.",
		"  Its weight had not changed significantly, and she had no idea how it worked, but the one thing she did know was that there was a human being inside of it.",
		"  Its light weight was almost unnerving,",
		"  closer to empty air than a human being.",
		"  It was about as heavy as one would expect if they'd bottled a summer breeze.",
		"  Thought, that did fit her image of Soujuurou perfectly.",
		"\"It's just like Alice said...\"",
		"  She muttered to no one in particular as she recalled the past.",
		"\"This really isn't like me.\"",
		"  Aoko wore a bittersweet smile. Her usual moodiness was gone.",
		"  It was a dangerous world out there. It was good to have someone to keep her on her toes.",
		"  With a wry chuckle, she flicked the magical bottle with her finger and set off walking.",
		"  She could hear a bell in the distance, signaling the end of the play.",
		"  An ephemeral dream gave way to reality. In the grand scheme of things, it had been but an instant.",
		"  As the actors exited stage left, the last of the lights silently flickered out.",
		"  And so, the long-dead amusement park played its final role, as a memory for a boy and a girl."
