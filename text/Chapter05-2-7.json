		"「―――別行動？　あの二人が？」",
		"　駒鳥からの報告に、少女は不吉な響きを感じとった。",
		"　彼らはそれぞれ反対方向に移動したらしい。",
		"　遊園地の住人たちは目撃者の少年を追いかけ、あと数分で捕まえ、処理するという。",
		"「……どういう事？　追いかけているのは本当に彼？　青子が変装しているのではなく？」",
		"　駒鳥は羽をすくめて主人の疑いを鳴きとばす。",
		"　自分の目に間違いはない、広場方面に向かっているのは青子で、コースター方面に逃げているのはとっぽい小僧だと。",
		"「青子が彼を見捨てた、ですって？",
		"　……そんな簡単な事ならいいけど。",
		"ダンプティは彼に張り付いているの？」",
		"　駒鳥は自信満々に頷く。",
		"　他の鳥はともかく、夜目の利く自分ならここからでもあのカモネギっぽい坊主を見て取れる。なにしろ相手は<高|・><い|・><と|・><こ|・><ろ|・><に|・><登|・><っ|・><て|・><い|・><る|・>し。",

		"　スクラッチダンプティは、捕捉した対象が目を離した途端に落下し、破裂する時限爆弾だ。",
		"　対象がきちんと監視していれば落下しない、ある意味紳士的な“<童話の怪物|プロイキッシャー>”。だが乱戦時においてこれほどの嫌がらせもないだろう。",

		"　彼がどこまで逃げようと、あと少しでダンプティが仕舞ってくれるわ」",
		"　何処に行こうと、この遊園地―――いや、スナークが破壊されない以上、少年は逃げられない。",
		"　なら気になるのは青子の方だ。",
		"　あの少年を守ると言い切った彼女は、いま何処に向かっているのか。",
		"「……ここにいるかぎり、青子の動向は掴めない」",
		"　羽を広げて存在をアピールする駒鳥を無視して、少女は遊園地を見渡した。",
		"　フラットスナークはもうじき育ちきる。",
		"　他の安価なプロイとは根本からして違う怪物。",
		"　少女にとって代えのきかない、貴重な三体の使い魔のうち一体。",

		"“―――――――――”",

		"  She was filled with foreboding at the robin's report.",
		"  Apparently, they had gone in opposite directions.",
		"  The park's residents had set off after the boy witness, and it would take them mere minutes to capture him, so the bird said.",
		"\"What do you mean? Is it actually him they're following? Not Aoko in disguise?\"",
		"  The robin flapped its wings, chirping away any doubt.",
		"  It had seen them with its own two eyes. Aoko was heading for the plaza and the cocky brat was making a run for the roller coaster.",
		"\"Are you saying that Aoko abandoned him?",
		"  ...It sounds a little too good to be true.",
		" Is Dumpty still on his tail?\"",
		"  The robin nodded enthusiastically.",
		"  It didn't know about the other birds, but with its superior night vision, it had seen \"that sucker\" clearly because he had moved to a high point.",
		"\"And Dumpty?",
		"  He said to let him sing to the very end? That he may never get the chance again to do so for a fool this asinine?\"",
		"  Scratch Dumpty was a ticking time bomb that would drop and detonate the moment its target averted its gaze.",
		"  That is, as long as his target continued to observe him. In a way, he was a gentlemanly Ploy Kickshaw, though Alice wished he would forgo such niceties when in battle.",
		"\"...Let him have his fun. Keeping an eye on Dumpty won't save the boy anyway. Once the poem on his surface is complete, the door will open.",
		"  No matter how far he runs, Dumpty will end him for us.\"",
		"  Until the park, or rather the Snark, was destroyed, Soujuurou would not be able to escape.",
		"  Which meant the larger concern was Aoko.",
		"  Aoko had promised to protect the boy, which begged the question: where was she running to?",
		"\"As long as we stay here, we can't track Aoko.\"",
		"  Alice looked out over the park, ignoring the robin's attempt to get her attention with its plumage.",
		"  Flat Snark had nearly reached its full size.",
		"  It was a different breed of beast compared to the other cheap Ploys.",
		"  To her, it was one of her three most irreplaceable and precious familiars.",
		"\"...Yes. She's all yours, Snark.",
		"  Don't hold back until Aoko is brought to her knees.\"",
		"  Alice remained where she was.",
		"  With the same historical merit as the troll under the bridge and the poison-clawed reptile, Flat Snark was one of Alice's ultimate Ploys.",
		"  She was placing her trust in its reputation and ability.",
		"\"But don't forget. This is a game.",
		"  When the contest is over, return to me.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  The drifting fog ignored its master's words.",
		"  It was the one thing that Alice had misread.",
		"Flat Snark was a king, even among the other Ploys, of terrible, vulgar antics.",
		"  Death to the defeated. Gruesome tragedy to the vanquished.",
		"It found no pleasure unless it brought about total ruination of life and wealth.",
		"\"―――――――――\"",
		"  The fog billowed like wicked laughter.",
		"  After all, only a king had the right to decide the fate of the vanquished, and the Snark's greed could not be contained.",
		"  Thus...",
		"  It hadn't even the slightest intent to play fair, despite its master's orders."
