		"　　　　　　むかし、うつくしい鳥を見た。",
		"　はるかな青い空を、ぐるぐると、回るように飛んでいる。",
		"　もう鳥たちの時代も終わって、",
		"　とっくに人間の時代になっているのに。",
		"　あの鳥は地上で増え続けるわたしたちのことも、",
		"　より高さを増していくわたしたちの家にも、",
		"　工場の煙突から<煤|すす>をまき散らすわたしたちの文明にも、",
		"　まるで関心がないようだった。",
		"　いつまでも、いつまでも。",
		"　大空はもう誰のものでもないのに。",
		"　鳥は<気高|けだか>く。",
		"　古い野生の空のまま、力強く羽ばたいていた。",
		"　……けれど、鉄の音は響いて。",
		"　羽は撃たれて、シンメトリは失われ。",
		"　地に落ちた姿はずるずると無惨に映り。",
		"　ああ―――それでも彼は、最後まで鳥として羽ばたいて。",
		"　わずかに風をきって、瞳を<北|ソラ>に向けたまま、乾いた地面に墜落した。",
		"　……そんな光景を、今になって夢に見た。",
		"　あんなにも心に残ったのに、どうしてか、よく覚えていない。",
		"　あの鳥は―――どんなカタチをしていただろう？",
		"「はい、今日の授業はここまで。",
		"　試験範囲の総まとめなんかやっちゃいましたけど、これ、うちのクラスだけですから。よそのクラスには内密にお願いしますね。担任特権と思ってください。",
		"　ほら、現国の平均点ぐらいは学年一番にしておくと、皆さんも鼻が高いと思いまして」",
		"　ははは、と穏和な笑顔で語りかける山城教諭。",
		"　２－Ｃの担任らしい、心温まる気遣いに教室中が和むのであった。",
		"「せんせい、口元に本音出てるー。鼻を高くしたいのはあたしたちじゃないですよねー」",
		"「鼻っていうか面子ですよねー。センセ、里中先生に嫌味言われてばっかりだしー」",
		"「つーかハッキリ言えばいいんすよ、オマエらあたま悪すぎだってー。いやあまあ、うちのクラス見事なまでに体育会系ばっかりだけどさー！」",
		"「いえいえ。テストの点数だけが学生生活ではありませんから、僕から言うべきコトは何も。",
		"　先生方もそこまで目くじらたててるワケじゃないので、別にクラス全員が赤点でも僕の人生には何ら関わりはないんですけどねー。",
		"　しかし一方ではひとり、厄介な御仁がおりまして」",
		"「皆さんが選んだ全校生徒代表の方なんですが、これが恐ろしいのなんの。",
		"“テストの点数が低いのは生徒ではなく教育する側が無能だからです。教育委員会への報告準備はいつでも出来ていますので”と日夜<脅|おど>してくるんですよ。",
		"　それでも生徒たちが直らないようなら、その時は直接私が監督します、とか。生徒としてどうなんですかね、アレ」",
		"「――――――」",
		"　<和気藹々|わきあいあい>としていた空気が、一瞬にして氷点下まで落ちこんでいく。",
		"　２－Ｃ組の生徒たちも、誰が本当の敵なのかなんとなく悟ったようだ。",
		"「あー……そっか、山城センセ生徒会の顧問だったっけ……南無南無」",
		"「さすがは応援団を立ち直らせた女傑。教師一人退職に追いこむなど造作もねぇ……」",
		"「やっぱりなあ。会長、ぜったい歳サバ読んでるって。",
		"　あの迫力、同年代と思えねーし！",
		"　",
		"ほら、うちの女子と比べると特に。こう、おっぱい的に」",
		"「せんせー、木乃美だけでもＡ組に引き取ってもらえませんかー。そりゃ男子はみんなサルですけど、コイツだけレベルの違うサルですよ絶対！」",
		"「あれ。でも女史、Ａ組だけどあんまり成績よくねえよな？　中の上ぐらいじゃなかったっけ？」",
		"「そうだけど、別にいいんじゃない？　塾もいってないし、生徒会しきって、たまにバイトまでしてるんだから。あれで学年トップだったら逆に気持ち悪すぎ」",
		"「だよなー。首位は副会長に任せとけばいいんだよー」",
		"「はっはっは。まあまあ皆さん、うわさ話はそのあたりで。地獄耳という言葉もありますから。",
		"　じゃ、それなりに復習をよろしく。あんまり点数が悪いと冬休みそのものがなくなりますからねぇ。",
		"　あ、それと静希君、ちょっといいですか？」",
		"　山城教諭は教材をまとめると、草十郎に手招きをしながら廊下に出て行った。",
		"　休み時間だというのに、廊下に生徒の姿は見られない。",
		"　生徒たちの騒ぎ声は聞こえるものの、廊下はひっそりと落ち着いている。",
		"　窓のない廊下は閉塞感があるためだろう。",
		"　生徒たちにとって休み時間の憩いの場は教室内か、そのベランダになっていた。",
		"「なんですか、山城先生？」",
		"「いえ、そう大した用事じゃないんですけどね。",
		"　試験前にこんな話をするのもデリカシーがないんですが、気になったので。どうだろう、学校には慣れたかな？」",
		"「――――――」",
		"　担任の気遣いに驚きつつも、なんとなく嬉しくなる草十郎だった。",
		"　さもありなん。",
		"ここのところ不条理な人間に振り回されてばかりだったので、<些細|ささい>な<心配|こころくば>りでもぐっっと励まされるのだ。",
		"「はい。学校の造りや決まりなら、自分なりに分かってきました。友達も増えましたし」",
		"「そっか、それは良かった。うちのクラスは口の悪い面々だけど、その分気を遣わなくていいからね。静希君と相性がよくて助かったよ」",
		"「――――――」",
		"　おお、と草十郎は目を輝かせる。",
		"　蒼崎青子に『憎むべき<昼行灯|ひるあんどん>、教師にあるまじきのれんに腕押し野郎』と酷評される山城教諭だが、彼は彼なりに気配りの人なのだった。",
		"「アルバイトもほどほどにね。試験前だって言えばたいていのところは休ませてくれるから、あまり無理はしないように。",
		"　また、試験で困ったコトがあったら周りに相談しなさい。ひとりで悩んでいても時間の無駄だよ。ほら、学校っていうのは話し相手にだけは困らないから」",
		"　それじゃあ、と手を挙げて山城教諭は去っていった。",
		"　純朴な少年は昼行灯な忠告をまっすぐに受けとめ、なるほど、と頷きながら教室に引き返す。",
		"　そうして、",
		"「ちょっ、女のコトで相談だあ！？」",
		"　一分も待たず、山城教諭から受けたアドバイスを実行した。",
		"「そうらしい。難問にぶち当たっているんだ。",
		"深く考えてみて気付いたんだが、どうも、自分は発想が貧困らしい」",
		"　いまじねーしょんがよわいのだ、と無念そうに目を伏せる草十郎。",
		"「いや、豊かだと思ってたコトがビックリなんだけど……まあいい、こっちこい」",
		"　木乃美は呆れながらも草十郎の肩をつかみ、教室の<端|はし>に移動した。",
		"　真顔で「女の子は難しいと訊く」と切り出された時は吹きそうになった木乃美だが、考えてみると草十郎が自分から相談ごとにくるのは初めてだ。",
		"　バイト先でもたいていのものは辛抱強くこなしてしまうこの男が悩んでいるのだ。",
		"　これは、よっぽどのコトとかからねばなるまい。",
		"「で。なんかやっちまったのか、ｙｏｕ」",
		"「……。これから、やるのかもしれない」",
		"「木乃美。たとえばの話、まっどべあにハリセンボンみたいな女の子が入ってきたとする。",
		"その子は俺が嫌いで、まっどべあから出ていってほしいようなんだけど、俺はまっどべあを辞めるワケにはいかない」",
		"　なによりお金のために、と草十郎は熱弁する。",
		"　とりあえず頷くしかない木乃美だった。",
		"「……つまり、その女を追い出したいと？」",
		"「逆だ。なんとか認めてもらいたい。",
		"　隠していたけど、俺はその女の子が嫌いというワケじゃなくて……」",
		"　草十郎はむう、と眉間に<皺|しわ>を寄せる。",
		"　この男らしからぬ歯切れの悪さに、木乃美はははあんと事情を察した。",
		"　こと女性関係においてのみ、木乃美芳助の巡りの良さは三倍以上になるのである。",
		"「―――ははあん。はっはっーん。",
		"　なんだよ、ようはナンパかよ。むしろ仲良くなりたいってワケ？」",
		"　木乃美の指摘に、む？　と思案する草十郎。",
		"　彼本人、それがどういうコトなのかよく分からないまま、こくんと頷いた。",
		"「けど、どうすればいいのか分からない。そもそもどうやって、同い年の女の子と仲良く話ができるんだ？」",
		"「クラスの女どもとは話してんじゃん。あれでいいんだっつの、オレは羨ましいっつの。",
		"　持ち前の天然系で押してけばいいべ。",
		"　山育ちってのは稀少なアイデンティティだと思うぜ？　珍しいものは<活|い>かさないとさー」",
		"「そうかな。珍しいというのは、あんまりいいコトじゃない気がする。",
		"　だいたい、そもそも嫌われている場合はどうすればいいんだ？　クラスのみんなは親切だけど、相手はハリセンボンだ。いや、このさいハリネズミでもいい」",
		"「そういう場合はめげなきゃいいんだよ。相手が折れるのを待つって寸法だな。トゲだけに」",
		"　むむう、と草十郎の皺はますます深くなる。",
		"「このたとえ話は、ダメだ」",
		"　などと右往左往するものの、他にうまい喩えが見つからない模様。",
		"「ばっか。女なんてのは機嫌を取ってればいいんだよ。",
		"　まずは女の趣味とか、大事にしてるもんとか聞いて、そこをフォローすればいい。自分の都合より相手の都合だ。まずは<外堀|そとぼり>から攻めろってコトだな」",
		"「外堀……外回りか」",
		"「もち。その後は、ま、結局はこれが一番効果的なんだけどな。袖の下ってヤツ？　プレゼントで釣れ。",
		"　そん時の<需要|じゅよう>と<供給|きょうきゅう>さえ合えば、嫌われてても受け取ってもらえる。受け取らせちまえば、あとはそれが義理になるってもんだ」",
		"　いまのところオレはこれで連戦連敗さ！　と力強く語る友人に、何か間違った頼もしさを覚える草十郎だった。",
		"「―――けど問題がある木乃美。",
		"　たしかにごはんとか、そういうのをおごってもらうと嬉しい。けど」",
		"「そんな<余裕|かね>はないってんだろ。分かってる分かってる。",
		"　……ひひひ、仕方ないねぇ。そういう静希君のために、いっちょ割のいいバイトを紹介してやろうじゃねえのよ」",
		"「？」",
		"　教室の<端|はし>から、さらに<隅|すみ>へ。",
		"　木乃美は人気のないロッカーの前まで草十郎を連れこんだ。",
		"　それが他人には聞かせられない、悪質な勧誘の<類|たぐい>であるコトを草十郎が知るのは、これより何日か後の話である。",
		"　その夜。",
		"　洋館の夕食は、一面のパン尽くしだった。",
		"　テーブルの中央にはカットされたソフトブレッドが積まれ、",
		"　周りには色とりどりのジャムが置かれ、",
		"　ボウルにはレタスを中心にしたサラダ、",
		"　小皿には太さがマチマチなハムが並んでいた。",
		"　一般家庭の夕食、その平均をまだ知らない草十郎ではあるが、これがおかしな<夕食|もの>であるコトは感じ取れる。",
		"　率直に言って、手を抜いているコトこの上ない。",
		"「あ。チョコのペースト切れたままじゃん。",
		"　有珠、新しいの買っておいてって言わなかった？」",
		"「……今日は一日、部屋に籠もっていたから。",
		"　第一、チョコレイトを食べるのは貴女だけよ。自分のものは自分で調達をするべきね」",
		"　が、彼女たち的に、この夕食は普通らしい。",
		"　食事の準備は変則的な当番制で、今夜は久遠寺有珠のターンだった。",
		"　有珠にとって食事当番とは、平時は手間暇を最小限に抑える作業であり、祝時のみ腕によりをかけて調理する……ものだった。",
		"　無論、そんな有珠の哲学を草十郎が知るよしもない。",
		"　草十郎から見ても簡素な食事。",
		"　加えて、",
		"　ふたりの間にはこれといった会話はない。",
		"　食器の音、椅子ずれの音、時計の音だけが、サンルームに流れている。",
		"　ちなみに草十郎はと言うと、夕食は済ませていたので居間からサンルームの様子を眺めているだけだった。",
		"「草十郎、九時からアルバイトでしょ。行ってらっしゃい。私たちの事は気にしないでいいから」",
		"「ああ。じゃあ行ってくる」",
		"　青子の声に頷いて、コートを羽織る。",
		"　草十郎がもう一度サンルームに目をやると、",
		"　気のせいか、ばったりと有珠と視線が合った。",
		"「？」",
		"　今日一日、有珠は草十郎を無視し続けた。",
		"　視界にさえ入れない、という徹底ぶりである。",
		"　邪魔者として睨まれているのであれば合点がいくが、先ほどの視線に敵意はなかった。",
		"「……居間の様子を見てた、のかな」",
		"　きょろきょろと居間を見渡して、草十郎はロビーへと向かっていった。",
		"　草十郎の退出を認めると、有珠は不自然だった視線を戻す。",
		"「―――はあ、めんどくさ」",
		"　青子からすれば露骨すぎて呆れてしまう。",
		"　無関心を装っているのがバレバレなのだ。",
		"「……なに。<献立|こんだて>に不満でもあるの、青子」",
		"「もちろんあるけど、いつもの事だし慣れてるわよ。",
		"　私が呆れてるのはアンタの意地の悪さの方。",
		"　徹底的に無視してるクセに、相手の反応を<窺|うかが>ってるなんて女々しくない？　罠張って待ち受けるようなもんじゃない」",
		"「彼の反応なんて探ってないわ。そもそも興味がないもの。それと、今のは差別発言ね。女々しいという表現は女性軽視にすぎるわ。",
		"今の場合なら、貴女は矛盾している、と言ってちょうだい」",
		"「うわ、自覚ありときた」",
		"　同居人の指摘を聞き流して、有珠は夕食を再開する。",
		"　青子は呆れ顔のまま、ソフトブレッドをちぎっては食べ、ちぎっては食べるのだった。",
		"「じゃあここからは蒼崎青子としてじゃなく、共犯者としての質問ね。",
		"　有珠的に、彼を見逃していいと思える判断材料はない？",
		"　ありえないけど、実は彼も魔術師でした、なんてオチであったとしても、<洋|こ><館|こ>に住まわせるのは容認できない？」",
		"「その理由なら認めるわ。彼を許すのではなく、そんな事に気付かなかったわたしたちへのペナルティとして。",
		"　……そうね。今のは絶対にありえない話だけど、それと同じに、絶対の結論もまたないわ。",
		"　彼がここに住む選択を呑む場合すらあるかもしれない。気の迷いは、わたしにだってあるのだし」",
		"「ええそう、そういうコトよ。",
		"　今は私との義理とかプライドで冷静をたもってるアンタだけど、アイツの努力次第で少しは、」",
		"「それは諦めて。彼が何をしようと無駄だから。",
		"　貴女も知っていると思うけど―――」",
		"　そもそも、この少女は他人に気を許す事が出来ない。",
		"　多くの器物、多くの童話を再現する代償として、魔女は人間を嫌うものなのだ。",
		"「そんなのアンタ個人のトラウマでしょ。自分の意固地さを魔女の血統云々で棚上げするのはそれこそ女々しいわ。",
		"　いいじゃない、嫌いなら嫌いでハッキリしてれば。",
		"　私が気にくわないのはね、アンタのどっちつかずの態度よ有珠」",
		"「どっちつかずの態度……？」",
		"「そ。無視するなら徹底して無視してやれって言ってるの。",
		"　ガチガチに守りをかためて、そのクセ城門だけ開けて、獲物が油断して入ってきたら串刺しにする気満々とか、相棒として見てられないわ。",
		"　アイツにできるコトなんて閉ざされた門をあける事ぐらいだっていうのに、その機会さえ無くすのはどうなの？」",
		"「……ごめんなさい青子。もう少し簡単に言って。",
		"　その喩えは、ちょっと……」",
		"　何を比喩しているのか分からない、と言いよどむ有珠。",
		"　そんな相棒の無自覚さに、青子の苛立ちは一瞬だけ沸点を超えたようだ。",
		"「だから興味ないとか言っておきながらコナかけるなってコト！　あんなにチラチラ盗み見たら、アイツ、ヘンに勘違いしちゃうかもしれないでしょ？",
		"“有珠はああ見えて、本当は自分と仲直りしたがっているに違いない。じゃあさっそく部屋に押しかけてみよう”",
		"とか！」",
		"「―――そういうコトに、なるの？」",
		"「なる。少なくとも、私だったらいいかげんイライラして“話があるなら校舎裏まで来い”って決着つけかねないレベル。この<毒婦|どくふ>」",
		"「……そうだったのね。気をつけるわ。",
		"　別に、彼と話をする気はないんだし。わたしも、彼を見ていたというより、彼の手足を見ていたのだし」",
		"「？　手足って、なんで？」",
		"「手足は手足よ。彼個人には思うところはないけど、あの夜の出来事はまだ記憶に新しいから。",
		"それが少しだけ気になって、つい視線で追っていたのね」",
		"「あの夜って、遊園地のこと？　なんかしたっけアイツ？」",
		"「…………」",
		"　有珠の表情が見るからに不機嫌になる。",
		"　遊園地での敗北をいまだ引きずっているらしい。",
		"「飛んだでしょう、彼。",
		"　レールの上から、私のダンプティに向かって」",
		"「ええ、そんなコト言ってたわね。勢いでつい、一メートルぐらいだから飛んじゃったー、とか」",
		"　幸運な事に、青子はあの現場を見ていない。",
		"　草十郎が死のジャンプをこなした理由のひとつが、<自分|あおこ>がかけた暗示によるもの、としか知らないのだ。",
		"　一方、有珠はあの光景を時計台から目撃していた。",
		"　本当にわずか一瞬だけだったが、",
		"　崩れ去るスナークよりも",
		"　地上で月を落とす青子よりも、",
		"　目を奪ったその光景。",
		"「でも、それがどうしたの？　卵の仇討ちってワケ？」",
		"「ダンプティは壊れるのが仕事だから、仇討ちも何もないわ。",
		"ただ……人間の体って、あんな風に動くんだなって」",
		"　そう。",
		"人付き合いの少ない有珠にとって、草十郎の跳躍は初めて見る衝撃だった。",
		"　森の動物たちより何倍もバランスの悪い、二本の手足。",
		"　あんな頼りのない足なのに、あんなに無力な両手だったのに、鳥のように虚空を駆った人のカタチ。",
		"　それは都市で暮らす人間が、野生の<動物|ピューマ>の躍動を見る感動に近かった。",
		"「……気にしないで。機会があるなら、もう一度見たいと思っただけ。",
		"別に、彼に何を期待しているワケじゃないわ」",
		"「……なるほど。有珠のプロイってだいたいが人型じゃないしね。たんに物珍しさで見ていただけか」",
		"　はーあ、と両肩を落とす青子。",
		"　有珠の思わせぶりな態度が、新しい玩具を欲しがる子供の好奇心と知って落胆したのだ。",
		"　そんな同居人の態度に、有珠も異論を唱えなかった。",
		"　彼女自身、自分の抱いた感動が何なのか、よく分かっていなかったからだ。",
		"「夕食、明日は私が作るから。",
		"　試験前だってのにこんなしょぼくれたもん食べさせられたら、一夜漬けする気合いも湧かないわよ」",
		"「ご自由に。わたしも手が空いて助かるわ」",
		"　洋館の夜は過ぎていく。",
		"　幸か不幸か、異物混入による変化は、まだ表面化していないようだ。",
		"　翌朝、空に白みがかかりだした午前六時半。",
		"　冷えこんだ空気の中、なぜか草十郎は青子と一緒に登校していた。",
		"“いい？　洋館にいる時は、極力一人にならない事。”",
		"　青子はその忠告通り、こうして洋館を出るまでは草十郎の安全を確保している。",
		"　……にしても、",
		"「眠い。六時から登校とか、アンタも働き者ね」",
		"「そうでもないよ。三十分<仕|し><出|だ>しを手伝うだけだし」",
		"　期末試験を控えた状況とは思えない、<逞|たくま>しいまでの労働意欲である。",
		"「それより蒼崎、無理してないか？",
		"　別に、こっちに付き合う事ないんだぞ」",
		"「ご心配なく、生徒会室で仮眠とるから。",
		"　約束だし、門までは一緒に行くわよ」",
		"　青子は思う。",
		"　はたして、同居人がどんな罠を仕掛けているか。",
		"　まさか森の中まで<禁忌|タブー>を仕掛けているとは思えないが、念のためだ。",
		"　せめて行き道ぐらいは草十郎の味方になろう、と決めた青子である。",
		"　罠があるのなら行き道で解除すればいい。",
		"　一度解除……といっても青子には壊す程度しかできないのだが……してしまえば、しばらくは安全になるだろう。",
		"「ま、帰り道に関しては、有珠もそこまで暇ではないと信じるしかないんだけど」",
		"「？」",
		"　夜に罠を仕掛けて、解除されたら休むことなく日中に仕掛けてまわる……なんてマメさを発揮されてはお手上げだ。",
		"　その時はその時。",
		"　久遠寺有珠にとって、静希草十郎はそこまでするほどの外敵だっただけの話だ。",
		"　あの少女が頑なに守ってきた、魔女としての<矜持|プライド>を台無しにしてもいい程の。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　そもそも、その場合は青子がどれだけ尽力してもこの少年は守りきれない。日中のコトまで気を回すのは意味がなかった。",
		"　自分にできるかぎりの事ならするが、自分の範疇を超えた事はあっさりと切り捨てるのが青子の人間性である。",
		"　彼女にとっては、この方針が最大限の譲歩だった。",
		"　久遠寺の敷地から出る。",
		"　坂を下りて住宅地に出るまでふたり一緒だ。",
		"　ふと、青子は傍らの少年を盗み見る。",
		"「ところで、何か考えてる？」",
		"　青子は気まぐれで問いただしたが、意外な事に草十郎は質問の意図を察していた。",
		"“有珠をどう納得させるのか”",
		"　その難問を、彼は彼なりに考えていたらしい。",
		"　友人曰く。",
		"　この手の難問には大きく三通りの対応法があるという。",
		"　一つは外回り。",
		"“こいつは時間がかかるが、もっとも自然だ。",
		"　人間ってのは自分が好きなものを大切にされると、コロッと気を許しちまう。仲間意識ってヤツだな！”",
		"　つまり、ターゲット本人ではなく、ターゲットが大事にしているものに気を遣え、というコトらしい。",
		"　木乃美らしからぬ大人な意見ではあったが、残念なことに、草十郎は有珠の<嗜好|しこう>を知らなかった。",
		"　洋館を大切にしているコトは感じ取っているが、ここで洋館の掃除などをしても逆効果な気がする。",
		"　草十郎としては、大切すぎるものには簡単に触れて欲しくないのではないか、と思うのだ。",
		"　二つめは内回り。",
		"“でも、やっぱり本人を落とすのが一番早い。オレたちに魅力がないのなら、魅力のある外付け装備に頼るのだ。",
		"　―――そう、プレゼントなンだよ静希クン！”",
		"　即ち短期決戦。かつ、一撃必殺。",
		"　高価な贈り物で相手の意識を変えろ、というコトらしい。",
		"　素晴らしい作戦だ、と草十郎も思う。",
		"　なによりシンプルなのがいい。わかりやすいのは彼にとってありがたい。",
		"　しかし―――つまるところ、それも一つ目の作戦と同じ気がする。",
		"　なにより、先立つものがないのが致命的だ。",
		"“あとは……まあ、<見|ケン>ってヤツ？",
		"　オレにはよくわかんねえけどさー、やりすぎると悪い印象を持たれるとか殿下がいってたなー。",
		"　アタシ、いま落とされてる！　って意識させちゃダメなんだとよ。付き合った後で、アレ、アタシ落とされた？　と気づかせるのが上等なんだとか”",
		"　言わんとするところはまったく分からないが、要は無理をするな、というコトらしい。",
		"　まったく同感だ。",
		"　気に入られる為に努力するのは正しい。",
		"　けれど、それにも段階があるのでは、と草十郎は思うのだ。",
		"　昔、山で見知らぬ狐のテリトリーに入ってしまったコトを思いだす。",
		"　あの時は手持ちの食べ物などを置いてしまったが、それ以降、狐の気配はなくなってしまった。",
		"　善意、懇意のカタチは人それぞれ。",
		"　一方的な善意は時として重荷になる。",
		"　なので、",
		"「大丈夫、考えてるよ。とりあえず自分にできるコトとか、したいコトをしようと思う。",
		"安心してくれ。蒼崎に忠告されたコトすら、きちんと守る方針だ」",
		"「――――――」",
		"　まかせろ、と胸を張る草十郎。",
		"　まったく頼り甲斐のない返答に、ほんと大丈夫かコイツ、とつい親身になってしまう青子だった。",
		"「学校にあるような<箒|ほうき>がほしい？」",
		"「そうなんだ。できれば安く買えるところ」",
		"「……静希の家、アパートよね。箒なんてモノ必要とは思えないけど」",
		"「いや、ちょっと気になるところがあって掃除がしたいんだ。ゴミ袋もあると助かる」",
		"「無駄な出費はできないって言ってたクセに。",
		"　ま、どうでもいいけど。うちのでよければ使う？　貸してあげましょうか？」",
		"「たぶん一日じゃ終わらないから自分で買うよ。",
		"　もとから欲しかったものだし。あると便利だよ、箒」",
		"　学校が終わってから、アルバイトの帰り道。",
		"　時刻はバイト終了時間から二時間ほど早い午後四時。",
		"　試験前日に学生を拘束するとは何事か、とお店の会計係に叱られたまっどべあ料理長は泣く泣く草十郎を送りだしてくれた。",
		"　そして。",
		"　この二時間のタイムラグこそが、草十郎の明暗を分けるのだ。多分。",
		"　本来の予定では、草十郎は生徒会の作業を終えてから下校する青子と合流し、久遠寺邸に向かわなければならない。",
		"　が、何を思ったか草十郎はバイト仲間の同期生に、この近くで竹箒を売っている店はないかと訊ねていた。",
		"「田舎者の趣味って理解不能ね。<酔狂|すいきょう>すぎ。",
		"　<三咲高|うち>の近くにまっずいラーメン屋あるでしょ。あそこの通りを終わりまで行けば沖田って<金物|かなもの>店がある。",
		"一式揃えるなら西口のホームセンターより安くあがるわ。",
		"　……どうでもいいけど、わたしの<自転車|チャリ>使う？　どうせ試験明けまで使わないし」",
		"　思わぬ助け船に目を輝かせるが、久遠寺邸までの坂道を自転車で、しかも荷物を抱えて走るのは難しそうだ。",
		"「いや、自転車には乗ってみたいけど、今回は遠慮するよ。じゃあまた明日、学校で」",
		"　少女に礼を言って金物店に向かう。",
		"　目的は安くて丈夫な竹箒と、大型のチリ取り。",
		"　できれば台車や添え木用の棒もほしい、といざ考えだすと色々なものが欲しい草十郎だった。",
		"　<午睡|ごすい>から目を覚ますと、少女は作業を再開した。",
		"　久遠寺邸には別館があり、その内部は図書室になっている。",
		"　少女の母から受け継いだ書物を収蔵したそこは、同居人である蒼崎青子も立ち入る事を<躊躇|ちゅうちょ>する領域だ。",
		"　久遠寺邸が時代に取り残された魔女の館なら、",
		"　この図書室は時代に忘れ去られた<御伽|おとぎ>の部屋。",
		"　童話を操る幼い魔女からすれば、必然、相性の良い聖域と言える。",
		"　少女は記憶を頼りに本棚を巡っていく。",
		"　……と。",
		"　なんとなしに顔を上げた時、おかしな風景を見てしまった。",
		"「…………」",
		"　優美な眉が不満げに寄せられる。",
		"　その後の予定は、なにひとつ守れなかった。",
		"　少女は日が暮れるまで眉のカタチを変えず、じっと、窓の外のおかしな景色を眺めていたからだ。",
		"　―――とまあ。",
		"　丘の上の洋館で寝泊りするようになっても、草十郎の日常に、とりわけ大きな変化は訪れなかった。",
		"　起床、",
		"アルバイト、",
		"朝食、",
		"登校。",
		"　慣れない授業、",
		"数少ない憩いの休み時間、",
		"放課後。",
		"　下校、",
		"アルバイト、",
		"仮眠、",
		"起床、",
		"試験勉強。",
		"　ささやかな少年のささやかな日常は、本人の努力とは正反対に、<為|な>す<術|すべ>なく流れていく。",
		"　状況は一向に変わらない。",
		"　館内では頻繁に青子が隣にいたり、",
		"　眠る前に有珠の用意した薬を飲まされたりするのも同じ。",
		"　前者は草十郎の安全を考慮した青子のフォローであり、",
		"　後者は、理屈は分からないが、やっぱり彼の安全のためだという。",
		"　そして。今朝も今朝とて何の変化もない状況に頭を悩ませつつ、草十郎は朝の紅茶を淹れていた。",
		"「…………ああ、そう言えば」",
		"　有珠との関係に変化はないが、大きな変化はここにある。草十郎の朝の一服は、煎茶から紅茶に変わっていた。",
		"　台所には様々な紅茶の葉があるが、ビギナーである草十郎には無用の長物だ。",
		"　彼の用意する紅茶は当然ティーバッグで、自分用に一杯<淹|い>れて<食卓|サンルーム>に移動する。",
		"　テーブルには先客が二名。",
		"　青子と有珠は無言で朝食を<摂|と>っている。",
		"　久遠寺邸において、朝食は完全個人主義だ。",
		"　ふたりの朝食は<婉曲|えんきょく>に言えば質素な―――真実を言うと用意に二秒もかからない、堅そうな石窯パン一つきりである。",
		"　青子たちは<時折|ときおり>言葉を交わすと、最後に紅茶を一口だけ<啜|すす>って席を立つ。",
		"　有珠はもう高校が冬休みに入っているのでそのまま自室へ戻り、",
		"青子はこれから学校なので鞄を片手に玄関へ。",
		"　草十郎も食器を片づけた後、青子の後を追って洋館を後にする。",
		"　ふたりは長い坂を下りて学校へ。",
		"　三日間はこんな風に、実に簡潔に過ぎてしまった。",
		"「ところで、あれから動きはあった？」",
		"　授業も終えた夕刻時。",
		"　青子の問いに、有珠は掴んだバターロールもそのままに、首を横に振るだけで『いいえ』と答えた。",
		"「そう。なら、<敵側|あっち>も次の手を考えているんでしょうね。",
		"　魔術師本体の居場所は見当ついてる？」",
		"　返答はまったく同じ。",
		"　落胆した風もなく、青子はバターロールを一口噛んでからサラダにフォークを突き刺した。",
		"「そ。私も試験が終わったら手伝うから、それまで悪いけどひとりでやってて。今日からあのバカを一夜漬けにしなくちゃいけないんで、余裕ないの」",
		"　それには思うところがあるのか、有珠はわずかに顔を曇らせた。",
		"「？　問題ないでしょ、有珠はもう休みに入ってるんだから。一日ぜんぶ使えるじゃない」",
		"「………………」",
		"　たしかに有珠は冬休み中で、一日のすべてを魔術師としての生活に<費|つい>やしている。",
		"　ただ、ここ数日はある理由で図書室に籠もりきりだった。",
		"　青子の言う“挑戦者への対策”に徹していたワケでもない。",
		"「有珠？　聞いてる？」",
		"「……分かってる。今夜から、そっちもやるから」",
		"　ため息まじりに返答して席を立つ。",
		"　……何が気になって、何が言いたかったのか。",
		"　ほんの二時間前、彼女が何をしていたのか。",
		"　それらの出来事を飲みこんで、有珠は食卓から去っていった。",
		"　その、二時間前の話―――",
		"　眠りに落ちて見る夢は、",
		"　たいてい、幼い頃の記憶だった。",
		"　イングランドの北西部。",
		"　深い霧に覆われたオークの森。",
		"　二十世紀にあっても人を寄せ付けない、鳥と獣たちの王国。",
		"　その一角に、彼女の生まれ育った家があった。",
		"　何代と続いてきた古い生き物。",
		"　偉大な、あるいは愚かな先祖の言いつけ通り、かたくなに純潔を守り続けた、原初の魔女の<末裔|まつえい>たち。",
		"　先代たちがどれほどの年月を重ねてきたのか、少女は正確に把握していない。",
		"　少女の母までは確かに伝わっていたが、少女には<口伝|くでん>でしか教えられなかった。",
		"　だから、彼女たちがその土地に根を下ろしてどれほどの年月が経っていたのか、知るものはもう誰もいない。",
		"　伝統はすっかり<剥|は>がれ落ちて、",
		"　角をいただいた白馬も、",
		"　虹色にはばたく鳥も、",
		"　少女が生まれた時には影も形も見あたらなかった。",
		"　代わりにあるものと言えば、少女の家には不釣り合いな、近代的な家具の数々だった。",
		"　それらは森の空気にも少女の肌にも合わなかったが、決して不快なものではなかったと憶えている。",
		"　時代遅れの母と、",
		"　時代遅れの自分に贈られた記念品。",
		"　それらに愛情を抱いたのは、",
		"　一週間に一度、<近くの都市|マンチェスター>からやってくる男性からの贈り物である事を、子供心に分かっていたからだろう。",
		"　……それも、今では失われた。",
		"　きらきら光る運転手付きの<高級車|キャデラック>も、",
		"　お城のような<花園|ガーデン>も、",
		"　たくさんの大人たちも、",
		"　<霧|きり>のように消えてしまった。",
		"　あるいは、霧の中に消えてしまった。",
		"　幸せに満ちた母の笑顔も、",
		"　はにかむような父の笑顔もない。",
		"　そんなもの、初めから森が<赦|ゆる>しはしなかったのだ。",
		"　……今はただ、疑問だけが残っている。",
		"　洋館には不釣り合いだった数々の異物。",
		"　何ひとつ自分が望んだわけではない高級品。",
		"　ただ<厭|いや>らしいだけの贈り物。",
		"　それを、あんなにも<愛|いと>おしく<触|ふ>れていたのは、一体どんな気の迷いだったのか―――",
		"「――――――」",
		"　閉じられた<目蓋|まぶた>がかすかに動く。",
		"　日が<翳|かげ>りだす前の午後。",
		"　少女は自分の耳ではなく、館が聞き届けた音に反応して、うっすらと意識を起こした。",
		"　辛そうに目蓋を押さえる少女を気遣ってか、鳴き声をあげる青い小鳥。",
		"　少女はぼんやりとした目で、",
		"「……不思議ね。ずっと昔の、鳥の夢を見たわ」",
		"　薄れていく夢の<内容|きおく>に<縋|すが>るように、独り言を口にした。",
		"　鳥と聞いて、我が事のようにはしゃぐ駒鳥。",
		"「……安心して。ほとんど覚えていないけど、貴方じゃない事だけは確かだから。",
		"　それよりこの音、なに？」",
		"　<肩|はね>を落としてがっかりする駒鳥に、少女は冷たい目のまま追及する。",
		"　……彼女が目を覚ました原因。",
		"　館の裏庭の方から響く、<耳障|みみざわ>りな雑音について。",
		"　裏庭からの雑音がなんなのか熟知していた駒鳥は、胸を張って主人に報告する。",
		"　聞いて。少女の眠気は、今度こそ霧散した。",
		"「…………そう。<目障|めざわ>りなだけでなく、<耳障|みみざわ>りにまでさせてくれるのね、彼」",
		"　つまらなげに漏らした言葉は、魔女としての責務とはまた違う、いわれのない個人的な<感情|いらだち>を含んでいた。",
		"　長らく使われていなかったポンプが、ギッコギッコと音を立てる。",
		"　久遠寺邸の裏庭。",
		"　じき日没を迎える森には<痩身|そうしん>の人影があった。",
		"　人影はきょろきょろと森を見渡しながら、草むらに埋もれたビニール袋や不法投棄された自転車を片付けたり、まれに、折れかかった木の枝などを補強したり、ひと思いに伐採などしていたりする。",
		"「む、これはひどい」",
		"　おそらく洋館に住んでいる人物、どちらかの手によるものだろう。",
		"　館の物置に放置されたゴミ袋が野犬によってここまで運ばれ、無惨に食い散らかされていた。",
		"　彼は持参した竹箒を片手に、黙々とゴミを片づける。",
		"「………………」",
		"　有珠は散歩中という<体|てい>で、その人影に出くわした。",
		"　<一月|ひとつき>に一度あるかないかの森の散歩が今である理由は、あえて語るまでもない。",
		"「静希君」",
		"「こんにちは。今から外出？」",
		"　気軽に挨拶など返される。",
		"　有珠は努めて視線を冷たくして、森の様子を観察した。",
		"「出かけないわ。",
		"そういう貴方は何を？　青子と一緒に帰ってくるものと思っていたけど、青子は？」",
		"「蒼崎ならまだ学校。こっちはバイトが早めに終わったんで、ここで暇を潰している。",
		"夕方になったら正門で蒼崎と合流して、洋館に戻るよ」",
		"「……そう。でも、貴方が先に帰ってきている事を、青子には伝えてあるの？」",
		"「あ」",
		"　しまった、と草十郎は不安げに言葉を切った。",
		"“いい？　洋館の正門前、五時だからね！”",
		"　その約束は当然守る気満々だった。",
		"　が、今にして思うと、それは“五時まで洋館に入るな”というコトだったのかもしれない。",
		"「……申し訳ない。蒼崎には黙っていてくれると助かる」",
		"「別に。青子との会話で、貴方の話題があがる事はないから気にしないで。",
		"　……それより何をしているの？　貴方と青子、今日から期末試験でしょう？　勉強、しなくていいの？」",
		"「うん？　勉強ならちゃんとするよ。",
		"　寝る前にきちんと、二時間」",
		"　どうも、彼にはまだ“試験前は念入りに復習をする”知恵がないようだ。",
		"　その考えはこの数時間後に<改|あらた>められる事になるが、今はまだ先の話だ。",
		"「それより森の荒れ具合が気になって。",
		"　この丘、どのくらいほったらかしだったんだ？」",
		"「…………」",
		"　有珠は答えない。",
		"　彼女がこの土地に住みはじめて三年ほど経つが、口にする必要はない。",
		"　沈黙する有珠が気にならないのか、草十郎はひょいひょいとマイペースにゴミを拾っていく。",
		"　少女から見ると<厚|あつ>かましいコトこの上ない。",
		"「―――貴方」",
		"　今すぐ消えて、と続きかねない声。",
		"「あいたっ」",
		"　それを、間の抜けた声が押し止めた。",
		"「いたた……なんか硬いの蹴ったぞ、今」",
		"　草十郎の足下には、錆びた金属の固まりが埋もれていた。",
		"「鉄の……なんだろう、このギサギザ。危ないけど、これ閉じるのか？」",
		"　不思議そうに足下の危険物を観察する。",
		"　それが野生の獣の<脚|あし>を捕らえる<道具|ワナ>である事を、彼は知らないらしい。",
		"「……<虎挟|とらばさ>みね。昔、この山には野犬が多くいたというから、その頃のものでしょう。",
		"　街の人たちが忘れていったのよ、きっと」",
		"「野犬……これ、犬を捕まえる道具なのか？」",
		"「ええ。踏みつけると、その口みたいなのがバネで閉じると聞いたわ。",
		"実際に稼働するところは見た事がないけれど」",
		"「そうなのか。でもこんな見え見えの仕掛け、引っかかる動物がいるのかな」",
		"　素朴な疑問に、たしかに、と有珠は頷いた。",
		"　虎挟みなんてものを見たのは子供の時以来だが、彼女も前から妙に思っていたのだ。",
		"　有珠は獣たちの<賢|かしこ>さを知っている。",
		"　なのにどうして、彼らはこんなあからさまな罠に食いつかれて、人間の手にかかってきたのか？",
		"「…………食べ物とか、置くのかも」",
		"　つい、思いつきが声にでる。",
		"「食べ物ほしさに、こんな、見るからに痛そうなものに近づくかな」",
		"「それはそうだけど、時と場合によるでしょう。",
		"　動物だって、死にそうなぐらいお腹が減っていたら、誘惑には勝てないわ。",
		"　罠にかかっても傷つくのは片足だけでしょうし。危ないと分かっていても、飢えて死ぬよりはいいと食べてしまうのではないかしら」",
		"　……そう。",
		"　たとえその後、猟師の手による死が待っていようと、目前の飢餓には耐えられない。",
		"　それが子供を養う親だったら尚更だ。",
		"　親犬は子供のために片足を犠牲にして、餌を手に入れた代償として狩られてしまう。",
		"　はじめから危険と分かった上での挑戦……なのかもしれない。",
		"　動物たちは生き残る為なら片足ぐらいと決断して、結果的に殺されてしまうだけの話。",
		"「人間と変わらないわ。",
		"　片手を失うことで死なずに済むのなら、それぐらいの取捨選択はすると思う」",
		"　自分を納得させるように少女は断言する。",
		"　それを、",
		"「どうだろう。人間と動物は、ちょっと違うんじゃないかな」",
		"　再度、自信なげな声が押し止めた。",
		"「……違うって、なにが？」",
		"「片足を犠牲にして助かろうってところ、かな。",
		"　動物には無駄がない。あれこれ考える知恵もない。",
		"　だから俺たちみたいに、<無|・><く|・><な|・><っ|・><た|・><ら|・><別|・><の|・><物|・><で|・><補|・><う|・>、なんて選択が、そもそもないんだ」",
		"「動物にとって、片足を無くすコトは命を無くすコトと変わらない。",
		"無駄がないという在り方は、何も失えない在り方なんだと思う。動物はみんな、少しでも自分の<価値|からだ>が欠けたら、もう生きていけない事を知っている」",
		"「……だから、この罠を見て、それでも進もうとした時、彼らには“足ぐらいなくなっても”なんて思いはないんじゃないかな。",
		"　はじめから助かる気はない。片足を失うと認めた時点で、彼らは自分の命そのものを差しだしている」",
		"　予想外の意見だったが、なるほど、と少女は受け入れた。",
		"　この少年は都会生まれではなく、まだ自然と共存している山村で育った人間だ。",
		"　文明で武装し、弱いもの、老いたものを助けてくれる社会に生まれたものではない。",
		"　これまでの彼の在り方は、創意工夫に満ちた便利な日々ではなく、自然との共存による生活だったのだろう。",
		"　そんな草十郎にとって、傷とは傷のまま、永遠に残るものだったに違いない。",
		"　そうでなければ、自然に生きる動物の在り方を口にできない。",
		"　……彼の言うことはもっともだ。",
		"　足を負傷して走れなくなった馬は、もう「馬」として機能せず、人々からも「馬」として見られないように。",
		"　野生の獣は、その手足を走らせる機能を<損|そこ>なった時点で、<生命|いのち>より先に己の<意義|かち>を<喪|うしな>うのだ―――",
		"「でもコレ、一度でも獲物を捕まえたコトがあるのかな」",
		"「さあ。仕掛けたのはわたしじゃないから」",
		"　親しげに話しかけられ、有珠は気を引き締めて返答した。",
		"　つい話し込んでしまったが、有珠にとってみれば虎挟みよりこの少年の方が何倍も邪魔なのだ。",
		"「それより。森の手入れをしているようだけど、何のつもり？　わたしへのご機嫌<伺|うかが>い？」",
		"　少女の瞳に敵意がともる。",
		"　自分に媚びへつらった時点で、有珠は草十郎を自分流に処置しようと決めていた。",
		"　不義理もいい。絶交もいい。裏切りもいい。",
		"　けれど、心にもない言葉で話しかけられる事だけは許せない。",
		"　それは少女にとって、何よりも重い侮辱だった。",
		"「うん？　森の手入れをすると、なんでそっちの機嫌が良くなるんだ？",
		"　こんなに荒れ放題なんだから、ふたりともこの森はあんまり好きじゃないんだろ。森がきれいになって気分が良くなるのは、俺だけだと思うけど」",
		"　が。有珠の敵意も、この少年にはまったく伝わらなかったようだ。",
		"「……待って。たしかに森には手を入れていないけれど、嫌いな訳じゃない。愛情はそれなりにあるわ」",
		"「それはヘンだ。なら、どうして放っておく」",
		"「愛情はあっても愛着はないだけよ。",
		"……でも反省したわ。これからは森の手入れも日課にいれる。",
		"　けど、貴方だっておかしいでしょう？",
		"　この森のどこに、貴方が気に入るものがあるの？」",
		"「おかしくはない。",
		"森はたいてい好きだし、この丘、ちょっと故郷の山に似ているし。",
		"　ほら。好きだった子にそっくりな子が困ってたら、なんとかしてあげようと思わないか？」",
		"“なんというか、人間として”",
		"　などと締めくくる草十郎。",
		"　その余計な一言は、有珠の心をかき乱すには十分だった。",
		"「……納得いかない。それだけで大切に扱うの？",
		"　本当はわたしへの当てつけなんでしょう？",
		"　だいたい、こんな森が好きなんておかしいわ。オークの木も根付かない、どこにでもある普通の森なのに」",
		"「？　別にそれでいいじゃないか。",
		"　森は普通にあるだけでいいんだ。なにもおかしくない。きれいなものをきれいと思うのは、いい事だと思うんだが」",
		"「……明確な理由もないのに？　この世のすべての森が好きだっていうの？",
		"　貴方とこの森には何の因果関係もないわ。",
		"　文脈として、貴方がこの森を好きになる理由がない。",
		"　理由がないなら、それはわたしへの―――」",
		"「？　好きってコトに理由は必要なのか？」",
		"「え―――」",
		"　不思議なものを見るように少年は言った。",
		"　それは、愛情に理由はいらない、という意味ではなく。",
		"　理由のない<感|も><情|の>はすべて嘘なのかと、問い返すような言葉だった。",
		"　……カッと沸き立っていた胸が冷めていく。",
		"　少女は声を荒らげた自分を恥じて、一歩、少年から身を引いた。",
		"「――――――」",
		"「………………」",
		"　気まずい沈黙。",
		"　有珠は何か、自分なりの<矜持|きょうじ>を示そうと言葉を探していた。",
		"　やりこめられたままでは立場が逆だ。",
		"　何しろここは自分の森、彼女の世界。",
		"　こんな、ただの人間に言い負かされたままでは魔女の<沽券|こけん>に関わると唇を噛んでいる。",
		"「ところで。これは残しておく？」",
		"　一方。そんな彼女の戦意もどこ吹く風で、草十郎は虎挟みに手を伸ばす。",
		"「……必要ないわ。わたしのものではないと言ったでしょう」",
		"「そっか。なら回収しよう。もう錆びて動かないけど、犬の歯みたいで物騒だ。残しておくと夢に見そうだし」",
		"　よいしょ、と重い鉄の塊を持ち上げる草十郎。",
		"　少年はそのまま木の陰まで歩いていくと、おかしなモノに虎挟みを放りこんだ。",
		"「……静希君。そのリヤカー、どこにあったの？」",
		"「どこって、町のお店だよ。",
		"　もしかしたらと思って買ってきて正解だった。ここのところ、どうしてか悪い予感だけはあたるんだ」",
		"　嬉しそうにリヤカーを移動させる、謎のボランティアマスター。",
		"　その笑顔を見て、この少年につっかかるのがどれだけ時間の無駄なのか、有珠はようやく悟った。",
		"「………そう。話しかけたわたしが、どうかしていたわ」",
		"　少年に背を向けて、洋館に足を向ける。",
		"　……まったく、青子の言うとおりだ。",
		"　余計な時間を使ったと反省しながら、有珠は徹底的に、あの少年は無視しようと<自|みずか>らに言い聞かせた。"

		"            Once, long ago, I saw a beautiful bird fly overhead.",
		"  Round and round, it circled the distant blue sky.",
		"  How high it flew in this era when humans,",
		"  not birds, reigned supreme.",
		"  And yet the bird was completely uninterested",
		"  in humanity's endless desire for expansion,",
		"  our creation of even higher homes,",
		"  or the smoke bellowing from industry's chimneys.",
		"  The sky extends further than the eye can see.",
		"  It belongs to no one, not now, not then.",
		"  The bird was a truly noble creature.",
		"  Flapping its wings powerfully across the wild, ancient sky.",
		"  Until... The sudden sound of cold iron.",
		"  A wing is shot, its symmetry gone forever.",
		"  Cruel and tragic, its body plummets downwards.",
		"  Not knowing its fate, the bird frantically beats its wings till the very end.",
		"  One moment soaring with eyes to the sky, the next crashing down to the dry, hardened earth.",
		"  ...This was the dream I saw.",
		"  No matter how much I thought about it, its details remained clouded.",
		"  What did that bird look like, for instance?",
		"\"All right, class dismissed!",
		"  That's everything that will be on the test. Please don't share it with the other classes. You're the only ones I'm telling-think of it as a homeroom bonus.",
		"  Remember, if this class gets the highest scores you can brag about it to all the other classes!\"",
		"  Mr. Yamashiro chuckled as he finished.",
		"  This was typical of the kind teacher responsible for Year 2 Class C, the master at relaxing his pupils.",
		"\"I think you've got that backward, Mr. Yamashiro. You're the one who's after bragging rights!\"",
		"\"Yeah, then he can finally get Mr. Satonaka off his back. We know he's been making fun of you all semester for our bad grades, sir.\"",
		"\"Err, duuh! We're like, total washouts, except for our totally excellent sports skills!\"",
		"\"Please, though it might not mean much coming from me, high school is about more than just your test scores.",
		"  Teachers don't really care that much about your grades, you know. Even if you all fail, it's not like anything bad will happen to us.",
		"  But there is one student who does bother me...\"",
		"\"I think you know who I'm talking about-you chose her to represent the entire student body, a monumentally awful decision.",
		"She makes a daily point to threaten to report me to the Board of Education, claiming my students' grades are the result of poor instruction rather than lack of studying.",
		"  She said if students' scores don't improve, she'd come supervise my classes herself. What kind of student even says such a thing?!\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  The warm atmosphere in the room suddenly fell below freezing.",
		"  The students of Class C now knew who their true enemy was.",
		"\"Right... I forgot Mr. Yamashiro was the student body advisor.\"",
		"\"The student president managed to revive the cheer squad, so I wouldn't be surprised if she can force a teacher out of their job, too.\"",
		"\"Yeah. I heard she can guess teachers' ages with 100% accuracy.",
		"  I can't believe she's the same age as us!",
		" ",
		"I mean, look at her compared to the girls in our class. Her boobs are way bigger!\"",
		"\"Oh my god, please get Kinomi moved to Class A, sir! It's hard enough with a class full of apes, but he's such a pig!\"",
		"\"But y'know, that girl doesn't even get the grades for a Class A member. Kinda middle of the pack, right?\"",
		"\"That's the point, dumbass. She doesn't need to go to cram school, she's on the student council, and sometimes does a job or two. It'd be heinous if she got awesome grades too.\"",
		"\"Totally... We should leave the good grades to the vice-president.\"",
		"\"Hahaha. All right, that's enough gossiping, everyone. It's not nice to talk about people behind their backs.",
		"  In any case, good luck with your studies. Remember, if your grades don't improve then winter vacation gets canceled!",
		"  Oh, and Shizuki, could I have a word before you go?\"",
		"  Mr. Yamashiro gathered his things and beckoned for Soujuurou to join him in the hallway.",
		"  There were no other students to be seen despite it being break time between classes.",
		"  Voices were audible in the distance, but the hall itself felt strangely quiet and calm.",
		"  Perhaps it was due to the sense of confinement created by the lack of windows.",
		"  Usually students spent their breaks either in their classrooms or on the veranda.",
		"\"What is it, sir?\"",
		"\"Oh, nothing major.",
		"  Sorry to bring this up right before exams, but I've been meaning to ask: how's everything going with school? You settling in all right?\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Though this level of concern from a teacher startled him, Soujuurou felt reassured.",
		"  It was only natural.",
		"After having had to deal with such difficult personalities lately, Mr. Yamashiro's trivial questions were refreshing.",
		"\"Yes. I think I understand the basics of school life for now. And I've made friends, too.\"",
		"\"Good, glad to hear it. Students in my class tend to mouth off, so don't take them too seriously. I'm glad you're able to fit in.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou's eyes shone brightly in appreciation.",
		"  In Aoko's words, Mr. Yamashiro was a brutish, forgettable, downright detestable man who did not even deserve the title of teacher. But Soujuurou found him considerate in his own way.",
		"\"Take it easy with your part-time jobs. We give students a lot of time off before exams, but don't push yourself too hard.",
		"  And if you have trouble with exams just ask the other students for help. There's no need to suffer in silence. If this school has anything it's plenty of people to talk to.\"",
		"  With a wave of his hand Mr. Yamashiro was gone.",
		"  The pure-hearted Soujuurou gave him a solemn nod as if to say he accepted the advice of his so-called forgettable teacher, and went back into his classroom.",
		"  And then...",
		"\"Come again? You want my advice about girls?!\"",
		"  Soujuurou had not wasted a moment in putting Mr. Yamashiro's advice into practice.",
		"\"Yeah... It's like I've hit a wall with them.",
		"I thought about it and thought about it, but I realized that I'm no good at figuring them out.\"",
		"  Soujuurou averted his eyes out of shame over his lack of insight.",
		"\"You coulda fooled me. I thought you were man with the ladies! Well, you came to the right guy. Follow me.\"",
		"  Shocked as he was, Kinomi grabbed Soujuurou by the shoulder and pulled him over to the wall.",
		"  Kinomi had nearly burst out laughing when Soujuurou, with a straight face, had admitted his difficulty with girls. But, he realized it was the first time Soujuurou had ever turned to him for advice.",
		"  Soujuurou was always able to break down any task at his part-time jobs into bite-size pieces, but he was clearly struggling with a different problem now.",
		"  This was going to take some serious effort.",
		"\"Okay. Give it to me straight, pal. How big did you screw up?\"",
		"\"I didn't screw up yet... but it might happen soon.\"",
		"\"Let's say a girl walked into The Mad Bear who's as prickly as a porcupine.",
		"She doesn't like me and wants me to leave, but I don't want to.\"",
		"  Soujuurou explained that he couldn't just quit his part-time job at the restaurant-he needed the money.",
		"  Kinomi grunted a few times to indicate he was still following Soujuurou's story.",
		"\"So, like, you want the girl to split?\"",
		"\"No, no. I want her to be okay with me working there.",
		"  Because the thing is... I sort of... don't not like her.\"",
		"  Soujuurou furrowed his brow.",
		"  Kinomi could not help but laugh at his friend's lack of manly resolve in his answer.",
		"  Girls were the one area where Housuke's skills and experience were triple those of Soujuurou.",
		"\"A-ha. Now I see.",
		"  That's just the art of flirting, man. You want to get along with her, right?\"",
		"  Soujuurou wasn't sure how to respond.",
		"  He nodded slowly without really understanding the implication of what Kinomi had said.",
		"\"But I don't know what to do. How can I get along with girls my age?\"",
		"\"You talk to girls in our class all the time! Honestly, you make all the other guys look bad, you're a natural at it.",
		"  Just keep being your usual clueless self and I'm sure you'll be fine.",
		"  Being raised in the mountains makes you Mr. Mysterious. You gotta use that unique identity to your advantage.\"",
		"\"Really? I don't think being unusual is such a good thing, though.",
		"  Like, how do you talk to someone who hates your guts? People in class are nice, but I'm dealing with a thorny beast here! O-Or maybe a hedgehog is a better metaphor...\"",
		"\"Don't be a chicken, man. You know what they say, a tiny thorn can stop a lion. She'll come around.\"",
		"  Soujuurou's brow sunk deeper still.",
		"\"All these abstract metaphors are too much for me.\"",
		"  He needed more concrete material to work with.",
		"\"Come on, dude. You have to put in the work to get on a girl's good side.",
		"  First ask about her hobbies and stuff she likes, then go from there. Think about what she wants, not what you want. You gotta blitz 'em from where they're weak, as they say.\"",
		"\"You mean... don't be too direct?\"",
		"\"You got it. And then comes the most important part: bribery. You gotta shower her with presents.",
		"  If the supply matches the demand, she'll accept your gift even if she don't like you. Then you've got her, she'll feel like she owes you one.\"",
		"  Kinomi then proclaimed with an odd sense of pride that this approach had resulted in only failure for him.",
		"\"There's just one problem, Kinomi.",
		"  I get that girls like being taken out to dinner, but...\"",
		"\"You can't afford it. I know, I know.",
		"  I got you covered, haha. I'm gonna let you in on a sweet little secret-an easy way to get you some cold hard dough.\"",
		"\"?\"",
		"  They slid from the side of the classroom deeper to one corner.",
		"  To in front of the lockers, where no one ever stayed for long.",
		"  It would be days before Soujuurou realized the suggestion he was receiving was of the illegitimate kind, the kind he should not have shared with anyone.",
		"  That night...",
		"  Dinner at the mansion was a feast of bread.",
		"  Soft slices lay stacked in the center of the table,",
		"  surrounded by variously colored jams.",
		"  In a bowl was salad-mainly lettuce-",
		"  with a small plate of unevenly cut ham.",
		"  Soujuurou may have had no frame of reference for what an average family dinner should be, but he could tell that this was most certainly not normal.",
		"  In truth, it was a first-rate case of laziness.",
		"\"Ugh. We're out of chocolate spread.",
		"  Didn't I tell you to buy some more, Alice?\"",
		"\"I've been locked away in my room all day.",
		"  And more importantly, you're the only one that eats that stuff, so you should buy it.\"",
		"  For these two girls, however, this dinner seemed to be completely normal.",
		"  They had a system of irregularly taking turns being in charge of meals, and tonight was Alice's turn.",
		"  Normally she would spend as little time and effort as possible, only truly applying herself when there was something to celebrate.",
		"  Of course, Soujuurou was none the wiser to Alice's unique approach to food preparation.",
		"  For him it was a plain, lackluster meal.",
		"  And when it came to dinner...",
		"  Not saying anything to each other was another staple of their meals.",
		"  The sounds of cutlery, the scraping of chairs, and the tick-tock of the clock were the only things to be heard in the sunroom.",
		"  Soujuurou himself had already eaten. At this moment he was watching the goings-on from the drawing room.",
		"\"Your part-time job starts at nine, right, Soujuurou? See you later then. Don't mind us.\"",
		"\"Okay. I'll get going then.\"",
		"  Soujuurou donned his coat with a goodbye nod.",
		"  When Soujuurou glanced again at the sunroom",
		"  he momentarily locked eyes with Alice, or so he imagined.",
		"\"Huh?\"",
		"  She had been ignoring him all day.",
		"  And not just refusing to talk to him-she had avoided him so much so as to not look at him all day until this very moment.",
		"  He could understand if he was annoying her as the outsider in the mansion, but he felt no animosity in her gaze just now.",
		"\"Maybe she was just glancing in the general direction of the drawing room.\"",
		"  Soujuurou looked nervously at his surroundings for a moment before heading to the foyer.",
		"  Alice only let her gaze return to normal when she was completely sure he was gone.",
		"\"Ugh. So much drama.\"",
		"  Aoko was appalled by Alice's brazen display.",
		"  So much so, her immaculate veneer of apathy crumbled.",
		"\"What's that, Aoko? Still upset over tonight's lack of chocolate?\"",
		"\"I would be, but I'm so over expecting other people to pull their weight.",
		"  No, what I can't stand is your attitude.",
		"  It's pretty sissy of you to pretend to ignore him while watching his every move. Could you be any more obvious with such a cheap trap?\"",
		"\"I was not watching his every move. I could care less what he does. And mind how you use the word 'sissy.' It reeks of sexism.",
		"Next time, just say 'you're a hypocrite,' okay?\"",
		"\"Well look who suddenly found a soap box.\"",
		"  Choosing not to rise to her roommate's jibe, Alice resumed eating.",
		"  Aoko tore off pieces of bread and ate them one by one, anger still visible on her face.",
		"\"Forget whatever issues you and me have for a minute, and take some advice from someone who knows a thing or two about messing with that boy.",
		"  Maybe, we need to cut him some slack.",
		"  Hypothetically, let's say it turns out that he's a mage too. Then would you be okay with him living here?\"",
		"\"Sure. But not for his benefit. I couldn't think of a more fitting punishment for you and I for not recognizing his ability sooner.",
		"  So, yes, hypothetically speaking, I would. But we can burn that bridge when we come to it.",
		"  But until then, perhaps I should accept his presence here, perhaps not. I reserve the right to have whims of my own.\"",
		"\"Then we're agreed.",
		"  You can keep your chilly distance out of duty to me or personal pride, but if he shows signs of improving, then maybe-\"",
		"\"Dream on. It doesn't matter what he does, he'll never change.",
		"  As you very well know.\"",
		"  Alice had never been the type to let her guard down around others.",
		"  The young witch despised humans, having recreated so many of their objects and fairy tales.",
		"\"You can't use being a witch as an excuse for every personal issue you have. Yet another example of you being sissy, if you ask me.",
		"  It's fine if you dislike him, just come out and act like it.",
		"  Stop trying to have it both ways.\"",
		"\"And what's that supposed to mean?\"",
		"\"That if you want to ignore him then ignore him for real.",
		"  You're fortifying the castle walls while leaving the front gate wide open, waiting for him to make the horrible mistake of exactly what you're urging him to do. It's gross to watch.",
		"  If you don't want him to come inside, then shut the damn door already!\"",
		"\"I'm sorry, Aoko, you've lost me.",
		"  Say that again in plain language.\"",
		"  Alice seemed unable to grasp Aoko's metaphor.",
		"  Meanwhile, Aoko had had it up to here with her roommate's lack of self-awareness and was starting to lose her cool.",
		"\"If you really don't care, then quit worrying so much about him! If he notices you gawking at him, he might just get the wrong idea!",
		"He's probably thinking, 'Alice looked like she wanted to patch things up. Maybe I should go stop by her room.'",
		" Or even worse!\"",
		"\"...You really think so?\"",
		"\"Yes! If it were me you were doing that to, I'd be dragging you out back and smacking you senseless. Bitch.\"",
		"\"Very well. I'll be more careful.",
		"  It's not like I want to talk to him anyway. And for the record I didn't look at him, exactly. Only at his arms and legs.\"",
		"\"And why in the world would you look at his arms and legs?\"",
		"\"Because of what happened the other night, though I doubt he even remembers.",
		"I was thinking about it and just...happened to glance over at his arms and legs.\"",
		"\"You mean at the amusement park? I don't remember him doing anything special.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Alice's expression soured.",
		"  She still felt the sting of her defeat.",
		"\"You saw the way he flew through the air, didn't you?",
		"  Off the track, straight at my Dumpty.\"",
		"\"Sure, you were raving about how he flew a whole one meter.\"",
		"  Aoko had not actually seen it in person, luckily.",
		"  All she knew was that the spell she had placed on Soujuurou was part of the reason he survived that jump of death.",
		"  Alice on the other hand had observed the whole scene from the clock tower.",
		"  It had only lasted an instant,",
		"  but it had burned itself into her mind's eye,",
		"  more than when her precious moon had fallen at Aoko's hands",
		"  and Flat Snark had come tumbling down.",
		"\"So that's it. You wanna get back at him for what happened to Dumpty, do you?\"",
		"\"Dumpty's destruction was purely business. I feel no need for retaliation.",
		" I was just intrigued to observe the movement of a human body.\"",
		"  As it goes...",
		"For someone with as little human interaction as Alice, Soujuurou's leap must have appeared quite remarkable.",
		"  Particularly because his legs were orders of magnitude less capable than those of an animal in the forest.",
		"  And yet, even with such feeble legs, with those meek arms of his, he managed to fly through the open air like a bird.",
		"  To her, it was akin to the feeling city folk get when they see a wild creature in its natural habitat.",
		"\"...Forget I mentioned it. I just hope I can witness that again someday.",
		"And when I say 'human' I am not referring to him.\"",
		"\"...I see. It was novel for you. It makes sense considering most of your Ploys have non-human forms.\"",
		"  Aoko sighed and released the tension from her shoulders.",
		"  She was disappointed to discover that Alice's behavior stemmed from simple curiosity, like that of a child with a new toy.",
		"  And Alice was in no position to take issue with her reaction.",
		"  And how could she? She was not entirely sure what it was that she herself was feeling.",
		"\"I'll make dinner tomorrow.",
		"  Another meal like this before exams is going to make it impossible to study.\"",
		"\"No complaints from me. I certainly wouldn't mind the free time.\"",
		"  Night came and went in the mansion.",
		"  For better or worse, the disturbances caused by the foreign invader had not yet caused the kettle to boil over.",
		"  The next morning, at six-thirty, as sunlight spread out across the sky...",
		"  Soujuurou walked to school with Aoko in the chilly morning air.",
		"\"So try not to ever be alone in the house. Okay?\"",
		"  It was her intention to keep Soujuurou safe until he left the mansion.",
		"  Nonetheless...",
		"\"God I'm sleepy. What's the deal with going to school so early?\"",
		"\"I'm not. I have to pull a thirty-minute shift helping with deliveries.\"",
		"  His work ethic was a little too strong for a student entering finals.",
		"\"Are you sure you're not pushing yourself too hard, Aozaki?",
		"  You don't need to keep tabs on me, you know.\"",
		"\"Oh don't you worry. I'll catch up on some sleep in the student council's room when we're done.",
		"  I promised I'd walk you as far as the front gate, and I plan to stick to it.\"",
		"  But internally, Aoko was worried.",
		"  What traps did her roommate have in store for him?",
		"  She could not imagine Alice had planned anything to go down in the woods, but she wanted to be safer than sorry.",
		"  The least she could do was accompany Soujuurou to school. That much she was firmly committed to.",
		"  Any traps that presented themselves could then be dealt with on the spot.",
		"  Well, not \"dealt with\" so much as destroyed, since that was Aoko's forte. But that would be enough to keep him safe for the time being.",
		"\"As for when you get out of school, all we can do is hope that Alice is short on free time today.\"",
		"\"Err... Okay?\"",
		"  If Alice was willing to put all her energy into a new trap after the first had failed, then they were as good as dead anyway.",
		"  But Aoko would cross that road when she came to it.",
		"  It all depended on how deep Alice's dislike of Soujuurou really went.",
		"  It would have to be enough to make her abandon her pride as a witch, something she had protected fervently until now.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  If that were the case Aoko knew she would never be able to keep him safe. The moment twenty-four seven protection became necessary was the moment she had failed.",
		"  Her character led her to focus on what she could do in the here and now, and ignore the rest.",
		"  And this current plan of hers was her best attempt at doing right by everyone.",
		"  They left behind the Kuonji Estate.",
		"  And the two remained together until the residential area at the bottom of the hill.",
		"  Where Aoko glanced casually at Soujuurou.",
		"\"So, any thoughts?\"",
		"  Surprisingly, Soujuurou saw through her harmless question and sensed the bigger issue.",
		"How was he going to win Alice over?",
		"  In fact he had been thinking about that very question.",
		"  According to his friend...",
		"  There were three basic approaches he could take.",
		"  One was the roundabout approach.",
		"\"This way takes the longest, but it's the most natural.",
		"  Humans love it when you pay attention to the things they like, just as friends do.\"",
		"  In other words, instead of focusing on the person one wishes to win over, one should focus on their interests.",
		"  It was a surprisingly mature opinion coming from Kinomi. Unfortunately, Soujuurou had no idea what sort of things Alice liked.",
		"  She seemed very fond of the mansion, but what could he do-clean it for her? He sensed that would have a reverse effect.",
		"  He had the distinct feeling she would not want him touching what was precious to her.",
		"  The second approach was to take the inner track.",
		"\"It's the fastest way to get someone to fall for you. When you can't coast on your natural good looks and charm, that's what your wallet is for.",
		"  You know what I'm talking about-gifts!\"",
		"  A quick-and-dirty strategy-the assassin's strike.",
		"  Manipulate someone's feelings with an expensive gift.",
		"  To Soujuurou, this sounded like his best chance.",
		"  The approach was easy for him to grasp, and he appreciated its simplicity.",
		"  However, he had the same concerns as with the first approach.",
		"  A step was missing, and without this step the plan was bound to fail.",
		"\"The only other option is...well, I guess you could call it 'wait and see.'",
		"  I don't fully understand it myself, but they say if you try too hard, your plan's bound to backfire.",
		"  Like, you don't ever want the girl to have a sudden epiphany of 'Oh, now I love him!' It's better that it dawns on her after you've hung out together for a while, like, 'Wait...I think I like him!'\"",
		"  Though Soujuurou did not quite grasp the details he understood the basic idea: Don't press your luck.",
		"  He knew that much was good advice.",
		"  He would have to try extremely hard to get on Alice's good side.",
		"  And he could tell it would be a long process to get there.",
		"  Soujuurou recalled the time he had wandered inside a fox's territory in the mountains.",
		"  He had left some food on the ground for the fox, and then it never bothered him again.",
		"  What is considered good will and kindness varies from person to person.",
		"  But if there is enough good will from one side, regardless of whether that good will is reciprocated, the other side will eventually start to feel an obligation to do so.",
		"  That was key.",
		"\"It's okay, I'll think of something. For now, I can only do... what I can do.",
		"Don't worry. I've taken your counsel to heart, Aozaki.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou seemed ready to face things head on.",
		"  His answer did little to reassure Aoko, however. She found herself more concerned about his safety than ever before.",
		"\"You're looking for a broom like the ones at school?\"",
		"\"Yeah. The cheaper the better.\"",
		"\"Don't you live in an apartment? Who needs a broom in an apartment?\"",
		"\"Well, you know, I've been wanting to clean things up a little. I could use some trash bags, too.\"",
		"\"Aren't you supposed to be broke or something?",
		"  Whatever. Wanna use my broom then? I'll lend it to you if you want.\"",
		"\"Actually... I need it for longer than one day, so maybe it's best I buy my own.",
		"  I mean, I always wanted my own broom. Brooms are nice to have around, you know?\"",
		"  Soujuurou was on his way home from his part-time job after school.",
		"  It was four in the afternoon, two hours earlier than his part-time job would have normally ended.",
		"  The Mad Bear's head chef had gotten in trouble with the accountant for making a student work the day before exams. Thus, Soujuurou's boss had tearfully sent him home early.",
		"  And that is when it happened.",
		"  The interruption to his standard schedule must have been just the shock he needed.",
		"  Normally, he would meet up with Aoko after she was done with student council affairs and go home with her.",
		"  However, today, Soujuurou was asking the other students who worked at the same place if they knew any shops in the area where he could buy a broom.",
		"\"God, what's wrong with you? People from the countryside are like, so weird.",
		"  Anyway... You know that nasty ramen place near school? Just go to the end of that street and there's a hardware store called Okita.",
		"It's way cheaper than the home supply store to the west of the station, as long as they have what you want, anyway.",
		"  Use my bicycle if you want, I don't care. I won't need it until exams are over anyway.\"",
		"  Soujuurou's eyes lit up as if he had met his savior. But biking uphill to the mansion, let alone with a package to carry, was not a pretty thought.",
		"\"I appreciate the offer, but I'll pass. See you at school tomorrow!\"",
		"  Saying farewell to his co-workers he headed to the hardware store.",
		"  He needed a cheap and sturdy bamboo broom and a large dustpan to go with it.",
		"  If possible, a pushcart and stick for a splint would have been nice, too. As it happened, Soujuurou wanted quite a few things.",
		"  Alice returned to her work after waking from her nap.",
		"  The Kuonji Estate had an annex that housed a library.",
		"  The library was filled with books handed down to her from her mother, so it was Alice's territory such that even Aoko dared not enter.",
		"  If the mansion was a witch's abode, left behind by the times,",
		"  the library was a fairy-tale quarters, lost to the ages.",
		"  It was a natural sanctuary for the young witch who could command Ploys to do her bidding.",
		"  She relied on her memory to recall the location of each book on the many shelves.",
		"  And then she saw it.",
		"  Upon raising her head she was met with the most unusual of sights.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Her elegant eyebrows bristled in distaste.",
		"  From that moment on, she failed to accomplish anything she had planned for that day.",
		"  She was instead forced to stare at the strange sight outside her window, eyebrows fixed in that position until the sun set.",
		"  Ah well.",
		"  Moving into the grand mansion on the hill had not brought any major changes to Soujuurou's day-to-day schedule.",
		"  He woke up,",
		" went to his part-time job,",
		" ate breakfast,",
		" and went to school.",
		"  Classes came and went, still strange and new,",
		" broken up by rare and brief moments of rest,",
		" until the school day ended.",
		"  He left school,",
		" went to his part-time job,",
		" slept,",
		" woke up,",
		" and studied for exams.",
		"  A modest life for a modest young man, continuing every day in the same fashion despite his best efforts to change his fortune.",
		"  But nothing ever really changes.",
		"  Whether Aoko was by his side in the mansion, as was frequently the case,",
		"  or whether Alice was making him drink some potion she prepared before going to bed.",
		"  The former was an attempt by Aoko to make him feel better,",
		"  the latter was some attempt to keep him safe, even if he did not fully appreciate it.",
		"  Then, one day, a day like any other, while Soujuurou was pouring himself some tea as he worried over the lack of change in his life...",
		"\"...Oh, by the way.\"",
		"  His relationship with Alice was the same as ever, but there was one major change this morning-he was drinking black tea instead of green.",
		"  Though there were all sorts of different types of tea to be found in the kitchen, a newcomer to the world of tea like Soujuurou could not tell one of them from the next.",
		"  Naturally his tea-making skills were limited to tea bags, one of which he placed in his cup before returning to the dining table.",
		"  Alice and Aoko were already seated.",
		"  The two were eating in silence.",
		"  In this household it was everyone for themselves when it came to breakfast.",
		"  The diplomatic description of their breakfasts would be \"simple.\" The more accurate description would be \"two slices of stale bread prepared in seconds.\"",
		"  Aoko exchanged a word or two with Alice, took a sip of tea, and stood up from her seat.",
		"  Since it was winter break for the high-schooler Alice, she returned to her room after eating as she normally did,",
		" while Aoko headed to the front door, shoes in hand, ready for school.",
		"  After hurriedly clearing the table, Soujuurou rushed out the door after Aoko.",
		"  Together they walked down the long hill in the direction of school.",
		"  They had spent three days following this very simple routine.",
		"\"So, any word on you-know-who?\"",
		"  School had ended, and evening had arrived.",
		"  Buttered bread roll in one hand, Alice replied with a simple, silent shake of her head.",
		"\"Thought so. The enemy must be considering their next move too.",
		"  Have you figured out where the mage is?\"",
		"  Her response was exactly the same.",
		"  Without showing the slightest sign of dejection she continued to chew the roll and took a stab at her salad.",
		"\"Okay then. I'll help you once exams are over if you can manage on your own till then. I have to help that idiot study so my schedule is pretty warped.\"",
		"  Alice's face grew dour as if she had something to get off her chest.",
		"\"Don't give me that look. You're on winter break, you can spend all day working on it, can't you?\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Alice was indeed on vacation and could spend all day every day on her work as a mage.",
		"  Yet she had spent the past few days holed up in the library instead.",
		"  She was hardly devoting herself to \"dealing with the challenger,\" as Aoko put it.",
		"\"Alice? Are you listening?\"",
		"\"Yes. I'll get to work on it tonight.\"",
		"  Sighing, she stood up.",
		"  What was bothering Alice, and what was it she wanted to say?",
		"  What had she been doing only two hours earlier?",
		"  The young witch took her leave from the breakfast table without offering a single clue.",
		"  Two hours earlier...",
		"  Her dreams at night often involved",
		"  memories from when she was young.",
		"  In the northeast of England,",
		"  there was a misty oak forest.",
		"  This was a land of birds and beasts, a land untouched by the modern era, where no human dared to enter.",
		"  There, deep within the woods, was the home where she was born and raised.",
		"  The woods were an ancient creature unto themselves, existing for generations.",
		"  Her venerable-or perhaps foolish-ancestors had insisted on maintaining its purity, passing this tradition of the First Witches down to their descendants.",
		"  Alice did not know for certain how far back her family line extended.",
		"  This knowledge had been passed down the generations without fail until her mother, but Alice only knew what she'd been taught via oral tradition.",
		"  Thus, no one alive knew exactly when those first women made those woods their home.",
		"  The traditions had been forgotten,",
		"  and by the time she was born",
		"  there were no horned white horses,",
		"  no rainbow-colored birds flying in the sky.",
		"  Instead, what she had was a collection of modern furniture.",
		"  Furniture that was neither befitting those woods' legacy, nor the rooms it sat in. And though their fabric was far too rough for a young woman's skin, still they were not wholly uncomfortable to sit on.",
		"  The collection was her inheritance granted to her mother and then to her,",
		"  both old-fashioned women from a bygone era.",
		"  She knew the furniture had been a gift from a man from nearby Manchester who visited her mother once a week,",
		"  and this pleased her somehow in a childlike way, stoking her sense of nostalgia.",
		"  Indeed, only nostalgia and old furniture remained.",
		"  No sparkling Cadillac with a chauffeur,",
		"  no gardens grand enough for a castle,",
		"  and no adults filling the space with life.",
		"  They had all disappeared like the mist.",
		"  ...Or perhaps they disappeared into the mist.",
		"  No longer could Alice see the smiling faces of her parents, her mother's filled with happiness",
		"  and her father's sweet as a honeycomb.",
		"  The woods had prohibited such things from her earliest days.",
		"  ...All that remained were hazy doubts.",
		"  Still, countless oddities around the mansion remained.",
		"  There were priceless items which she had never wished for.",
		"  Gifts, which only served to irritate her.",
		"  How could she have ever handled them so fondly? Alice found herself unable to relate to her former self.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Her closed eyelids fluttered.",
		"  It was afternoon, the sun still hiding behind clouds.",
		"  She was called back to the waking world, not by the sound her own ears could hear, but by the mansion reacting to it.",
		"  A small bluish bird piped up, perhaps worried by the painful-looking way she squeezed her eyes shut.",
		"  Her vision was still blurred with sleep.",
		"\"How odd. You look just like a bird I met in my dreams once upon a time.\"",
		"  Speaking these words, she felt the details of her dream fading.",
		"  The robin frolicked, as if proud to be the bird of which she spoke.",
		"\"Don't worry. I can scarcely recall the dream now, but I know it wasn't you I dreamt of.",
		"  ...And what's making that noise?\"",
		"  She stared coldly at the now disappointed bird as she demanded her answer.",
		"  Then, she realized what had drawn her out of her slumber.",
		"  It was the grating noise ringing out from the mansion's rear courtyard.",
		"  The robin had detected the clamor, and come to alert the head of household.",
		"  She listened. And all at once her grogginess vanished without a trace.",
		"\"Ah yes. He's not only hard on the eyes, but also on the ears, it seems.\"",
		"  Her disinterested remark had less to do with her position as resident witch, than with her irrational irritation.",
		"  A long-unused pump was the source of the ruckus.",
		"  There, in the Kuonji Estate's courtyard...",
		"  A slim silhouette was visible against the trees, as the day crept closer to sundown.",
		"  Glancing furtively around the trees, the figure was gathering everything from plastic bags to an illegally abandoned bicycle. At times, the figure attempted to mend broken tree branches, while at other times he resolutely pruned them.",
		"\"Hrm. What a mess.\"",
		"  It was surely the fault of one of the two roommates.",
		"  Wild dogs had gotten into the mansion's storage shed, torn open some trash bags, and made an enormous mess.",
		"  Bamboo broom in hand, Soujuurou set himself to silently tidying things up.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Alice approached the figure on the pretense of taking a morning walk.",
		"  She took such walks once a month at most, but she had special reason for taking this one.",
		"\"Shizuki.\"",
		"\"Hello. Are you going out?\"",
		"  He replied casually.",
		"  Alice surveyed the trees around her with as cold a gaze as she could muster.",
		"\"No, I'm not going anywhere.",
		"And what, may I ask, are you doing out here? I thought you would be coming home from school with Aoko later. Where is she?\"",
		"\"Aozaki's still at school. I finished work early today, so I'm just passing the time.",
		"I'll meet her at the front gate later and walk her back.\"",
		"\"I see. But did you tell her you were coming home early today?\"",
		"\"Oh. Uh...\"",
		"  Soujuurou stumbled over his words with obvious unease.",
		"\"So we'll meet at the mansion's front gate at five! Got it?\" ",
		"  And he had every intension of doing as promised.",
		"  But maybe what Aoko really meant to say was \"Stay away from the mansion until five o'clock!\"",
		"\"I'm sorry. Please don't tell Aozaki about this.\"",
		"\"Don't worry, I won't. Besides, we never talk about you anyway.",
		"  What exactly are you doing here? I thought you and Aoko have exams. Shouldn't you be studying?\"",
		"\"What? Oh, I haven't neglected to study.",
		"  I do two hours every night before I go to bed.\"",
		"  He was not yet familiar with the common student concept of \"cramming.\"",
		"  He would be in a few hours from now, however.",
		"\"I was more worried about the condition of the woods around the mansion.",
		"  When was the last time someone tended to this hill?\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Alice stood speechless.",
		"  She had lived here for three years, but there was no need to tell him that.",
		"  Soujuurou casually continued collecting trash as if Alice had not been standing before him in silence.",
		"  For her, it was one of the most brazen insults she had ever received.",
		"\"Why, you...\"",
		"  Her voice full of desire to extinguish his life.",
		"\"Yowch!\"",
		"  His simple cry interrupted her before she could finish.",
		"\"Ouch... I just kicked something really hard.\"",
		"  A rusty mass of metal lay buried at his feet.",
		"\"What's this spiky metal thing? I should shut this before someone gets hurt.\"",
		"  He inspected the dangerous object before him with a befuddled expression.",
		"  Apparently, he had no idea that it was a common trap used to catch wild animals.",
		"\"That's a bear trap. We used to have a stray dog problem up here.",
		"  Someone from town must have left it there.\"",
		"\"Strays, huh? Do people really use this to catch dogs?\"",
		"\"Yes. When an animal steps on it a spring makes that sharp part clamp onto their leg.",
		"Though I've never actually seen one in action, come to think of it.\"",
		"\"Really? It's so obvious it's a trap, though. What animal would fall for it?\"",
		"  Alice could only nod in agreement with his naive observation.",
		"  Though she had not seen one of the devices since her childhood, she remembered harboring the same doubts back then.",
		"  Alice knew very well how smart wild animals really were.",
		"  How could they so easily be fooled and delivered into human hands by such a simplistic contraption?",
		"\"...Some people use food as bait.\"",
		"  Alice let slip.",
		"\"And the hungry animal approaches even though it's obviously dangerous?\"",
		"\"Yes, but timing and circumstance play a key part.",
		"  You see, if an animal is starving to death, curiosity is bound to get the better of it.",
		"  The worst that could happen is injuring one leg. Even if the animal recognizes the danger, suffering an injury to its leg is far better than dying from starvation.\"",
		"  Indeed.",
		"  An animal lives knowing it might ultimately die at a hunter's hand, but the prospect of dying from hunger is unbearable.",
		"  That was doubly true for any creature that had young to look after.",
		"  A dog willing to sacrifice a leg to obtain food for its pup was easy prey for a trapper.",
		"  Perhaps it would try anyway, knowing full well the risk.",
		"  The end result was the same: the animal would risk its leg to survive, and end up dead.",
		"\"Humans are no different.",
		"  If losing a leg is what it takes to survive, anyone would make the same choice.\"",
		"  She spoke assertively as if trying to convince herself at the same time.",
		"  That was―",
		"  \"Humans and animals are kinda different, don't you think?\"",
		"Once again, his timid voice cut her off mid-thought.",
		"\"What do you mean 'different'?\"",
		"\"I mean, the whole idea that losing a leg could help you...",
		"  Animals do not squander anything. And they don't have such complicated thoughts, either.",
		"  They don't consider giving up one thing in order to gain another the way humans do.\"",
		"\"For them, losing a leg is the same as dying.",
		"Living without waste is the same as living without losing anything at all. Every animal knows that losing even a part of themselves means they're as good as dead.\"",
		"\"No animal calculates whether it's worth losing a leg or not at the moment they see a trap and decide to approach it.",
		"  That kind of thinking doesn't work for them. When they know they'll lose a leg, they're already prepared to sacrifice their whole life.\"",
		"  It was far from the response she had expected him to give, but she found herself nodding nonetheless.",
		"  He had been raised in a mountain village where people had to coexist with nature, not in crowded urban area.",
		"  His childhood environment was not a civilized or cultured one where the weak and old were protected.",
		"  No, he was accustomed to a lifestyle where mankind and nature coexisted, not one of infinite possibilities and convenience.",
		"  It was no wonder that Soujuurou saw injuries as something that, once inflicted, lasted forever.",
		"  If not, then he would not have explained the way wild animals live in nature in such detail.",
		"  His words rang very true.",
		"  A horse rendered unable to run by a leg injury could no longer function in the way a horse is meant to function. It would thus no longer be seen as a horse at all in human society.",
		"  Once a wild animal loses its ability to run, though it may still live, it loses its sense of significance in the world.",
		"\"I wonder if this one has ever caught anything.\"",
		"\"Well, we'd have to be the people who put it here to know that, wouldn't we?\"",
		"  Alice's tone was tense in response to his friendly and candid observations.",
		"  Though she'd been the one to strike up a conversation, she still found the bear trap far less of a nuisance than Soujuurou himself.",
		"\"In any case, I can see that you're trying to clean things up, but what's this all in aid of? Is this your attempt to get on my good side?\"",
		"  Animosity burned in her eyes.",
		"  She did not like being sucked up to, and decided that the moment he did so would be the moment she disposed of him.",
		"  It was one thing to be ingracious, treacherous, or even to cut off relations with her.",
		"  But she could not abide being spoken to insincerely.",
		"  For her, that was the ultimate insult.",
		"\"How would cleaning the woods make you happy?",
		"  It's only this bad because neither of you care, right? I thought I was the only one who felt bad seeing the grounds in this state.\"",
		"  It seemed he had not picked up on her animosity one bit.",
		"\"...Excuse me, I'm well aware that I haven't kept the grounds in the best shape, but it's not because I don't care. In fact, I love the trees in a way.\"",
		"\"Really? Then why don't you groom them?\"",
		"\"I love them, but I don't dote on them.",
		"However, I've reconsidered. I'm going to make tending to the grounds a part of my daily routine.",
		"  In any case, the only strange thing here is your behavior.",
		"  What interest do you have in these woods?\"",
		"\"It's not strange at all.",
		"I love woods, and this hill reminds me of the mountains back home.",
		"  When you see a person struggling who kinda looks like someone you were once sweet on, don't you feel like stepping in to help?\"",
		"\"You know... as a fellow human being,\"",
		"  he concluded.",
		"  His last uncalled-for remark upset Alice.",
		"\"So being raised in the mountains makes you want to clean up the backyard? No, I'm not convinced.",
		"  I think this is all an effort to butter me up.",
		"  Why would you feel so attached to an otherwise unremarkable wood like this? It doesn't even have any oak trees.\"",
		"\"So? I like it. Isn't that enough?",
		"  I like these woods just because they're here. I don't think there's anything wrong with finding something beautiful for no particular reason.\"",
		"\"No particular reason? Are you telling me you like every wooded area on earth?",
		"  You have no relationship with this wood.",
		"  There is no context or reason for your liking it.",
		"  And if there's no external reason, then it must be because you're up to something.\"",
		"\"...Do I need a reason to like something?\"",
		"\"Huh?\"",
		"  Soujuurou had uttered his question as if he had been confronted with an entirely new concept.",
		"  The cliché \"love needs no reason\" was certainly not what he intended to throw in her face.",
		"  He had simply asked whether feeling without reason could be real.",
		"  After boiling over at him, Alice simmered down.",
		"  She took a step back, embarrassed to have raised her voice at him.",
		"\"...\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  It was an unbearably awkward silence.",
		"  Alice searched for the words to regain her pride.",
		"  She could not leave it on that note or it would have looked like he won the argument.",
		"  At the end of the day this was her wood; her world.",
		"  Losing an argument to a mere human was enough to make any witch bite her lip at the dishonor.",
		"\"By the way, should I leave this here?\"",
		"  Soujuurou casually reached out toward the bear trap as if Alice's animosity had been a mild gust of wind.",
		"\"I don't need it. I said it's not mine, remember?\"",
		"\"Okay, then I'll get rid of it. It's rusty and I doubt it still works, and those teeth look pretty sharp. If I leave it here, I'll probably have a bad dream about it.\"",
		"  Soujuurou lifted up the heavy mass of iron with a loud exhale of breath.",
		"  He preceded to walk over to the shade of a nearby tree and toss it inside something unusual-looking.",
		"\"Where did you find that trailer, Shizuki?\"",
		"\"A shop in town.",
		"  I thought I might need it, and boy was I right. I'm getting good at listening to my gut instincts.\"",
		"  What an odd master of good deeds he must have appeared, so proudly dragging along that trailer of his.",
		"  Seeing the grin on his face, Alice realized just how pointless it was to try to converse with the boy any further.",
		"\"...It's my own fault for trying to talk to him. I should have known better.\"",
		"  She turned away and headed back toward the mansion.",
		"  Aoko had been right all along.",
		"  Realizing how much time she had wasted, Alice now fully agreed: she should do everything in her power to ignore him, utterly and completely."
