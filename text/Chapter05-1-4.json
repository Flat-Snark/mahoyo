		"それでも彼は彼なりに考え抜いた、気の利いた<台詞|いいわけ>を口にする。",
		"「明日は、どうも忙しいみたいなんだ」",
		"“だから、用件は今日中に済ませてしまわないか？”",

		"　それは嘘だ、と。",
		"　視線をいっそう鋭くして、青子は草十郎を睨んだ。",
		"「話は最後まで聞く。……どうしてかって言うと、一階の入り口あるだろ？　あの細長い通路。",
		"　なんでかあそこから先に進めないんだ。逃げたくても逃げだせなくて、仕方なく戻ってきた」",
		"　青子はわずかに目を見張った。",
		"　あり得ない、と驚いたのではなく、そこまでしていたか、という敵への称賛だ。",
		"「それに、さっきので完全に敵扱いされた。あの人形、こっちをじろっと<睨|にら>んできたし。",
		"　……いや、一瞬でよく見えなかったけど、生きた心地しなかったな。蒼崎も気をつけた方がいい。たぶん、よっぽど怖い顔をしているに違いないぞ、<彼|ア><女|レ>」",
		"「―――それはご親切に、どうも」",
		"「うん。なんで、これはもう他人事じゃないんだ。",
		"　蒼崎と人形。結論として、どっちが勝っても俺は殺されてしまうんじゃないか？」",
		"「……そうね。そこまでやってるなら、目撃者は消すでしょうね。私みたいに」",
		"「だろう。でも、俺はあいつには殺されたくない」",
		"「え？」",
		"　きっぱりと彼は断言した。",
		"　まるで励ますような草十郎の言葉に、顔を上げる青子。",
		"　……そうして、ようやく気づいた。",
		"　草十郎の顔色の悪さが、さっきより濃くなっている事に。",
		"「ちょっと待って。大丈夫なの、貴方？」",
		"「……まあ、醤油を<一升瓶|いっしょうびん>飲むよりは、ましではないかと」",
		"　彼なりに場を<和|なご>ませようとした軽口だが、額に脂汗を浮かべられては余計に重い。",
		"“……そうか、さっき人形に近付いたから……”",
		"　青子ですら吐き気に襲われる呪いの圏内に入って、草十郎が平気である筈がない。",
		"　……自分の洞察力の低さに唇を噛む。",
		"　あんまりに彼がぼんやりしているから、そこに考えがいたらなかった。",
		"「……下で隠れていようとか思わなかったの？",
		"　その方がどう考えても安全でしょ？」",
		"　ほんとうに分からない、と青子。",
		"「それは蒼崎が言う台詞じゃないな。",
		"　―――でもまあ、長話をしている時間もない。そろそろ追いついて来る頃だ」",
		"　通路に視線を向ける草十郎。",
		"　……鏡張りの闇からは、ざらついたオルゴールが聞こえだしていた。",
		"「さっき一階にいて考えたんだ。君がやられても俺は殺される。なら、まずヤツをどうにかするべきだ」",
		"「…………………。",
		"　貴方、なにが言いたいの？」",
		"　分かりきった事を、青子はあえて問いただした。",
		"　草十郎の決意の程を試すように。",
		"　その先を半端な気持ちで口にするのなら、やっぱり今ここで始末する、と見据えながら。",
		"「提案。アイツをやっつけるのに協力したら、俺の事は見逃してくれる？」",
		"「……助けられたぐらいじゃ信念は曲げないって言ったでしょう。",
		"それに、貴方に何が出来るって言うの？」",
		"「それは蒼崎が考えてくれ。得意だろ、そういうの」",
		"　協力者を適材適所にふりわけるのは指揮者の役割だ。",
		"　そもそもこの状況をまったく把握できず、また、自身と敵の差を理解できない人間に“何が出来るか”なんてコトを考えさせるのは間違っている、と草十郎は胸を張った。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　彼の言う通り、草十郎を知り、自動人形を知っているのは蒼崎青子だけ。",
		"　なので、青子の指示を全力でこなす事が“いまの自分に出来る事”だと彼は言った。",
		"　思考放棄に近いが、それでも、草十郎の提案は自分が無力である事を受け入れた末の、最大限の信頼に他ならない。",
		"「……。じゃあ、私の指示に百パーセント従うってこと？」",
		"「ああ。それに、これは恩とか義理の話じゃない。",
		"　ひとりだと分が悪いからふたりでかかるだけだ。善意でも厚意でもない。取引って言わないか、こういうの？」",
		"　信条的な物々交換だ、純朴な<瞳|め>が語っている。",
		"「――――――まったく」",
		"　……この少年にそんな知恵をつけたのは鳶丸の阿呆に違いない。",
		"　決して口にはこぼさないが、青子は少しだけ笑いたくなった。",
		"完全に一本とられたけど、なんというか、悔しくない敗北なんてものが、世の中にはあるらしい。",
		"「労働と報酬ってワケね。それなら理にかなってる。",
		"　うん、言いたくないけど―――」",
		"　少し間をおいて、やれやれ、と肩で息をする。",
		"　青子はふっきれたような、見ようによっては邪悪な笑みをうかべて、",
		"「―――それ、けっこう私の好みよ」",
		"　彼が向けたのと同程度の信頼を、まっすぐに投げ返した。"

		"  Mentally, Aoko bemoaned the disaster she was in.",
		"  The quality of this puppet was on a completely different level compared to the one from the park two days ago.",
		"  An auto-incanting perpetual motion machine was a rarity in and of itself, but this puppet was also equipped for battle with its extending arms and Gandr-projecting crystalline eyes.",
		"  It was a first-class product that, if put on the market, would sell for hundreds of millions of yen.",
		"  Although, that was only when factoring in its value as an antique.",
		"  For the purposes of combat, it would have made more sense to mobilize a significantly less expensive familiar.",
		"  To use such a precious commodity as a tool for murder marked this puppet's master as a completely different breed of crazy from the enemies she had faced up until now.",
		"  \"Vivo in somno. Solitarie putresco in inferis.",

		"\"...Here it comes.\"",
		"  A sound of a crackling music box filled the air.",
		"  The automata, animated by its own curses, approached.",
		"  The corridor measured approximately ten meters in length. Aoko lay in wait around a corner further down the hall, anticipating the puppet's appearance.",
		"  This was not to buy Soujuurou time to escape. Far from it.",
		"  Aoko had concluded that she couldn't make a break for it under the current circumstances.",
		"  Even if she did try to escape, and, by some miracle made it out of the house of mirrors, that was as far as she would go.",
		"  Outside, with no cover, Aoko would quickly be overtaken and skewered from behind.",
		"  As long as her magecraft was disabled, escape was impossible.",
		"  Instead, she chose to force the enemy back.",
		"  Her situation was not the most favorable, but neither was the puppet's.",
		"  Though this narrow hall gave Aoko no place to run, it in turn prevented the puppet from reaching full speed.",
		"  That was the weak point of this machine.",
		"  Automata of its era had a tendency to struggle with minute changes in speed.",
		"\"...<Connecting.|Set.>\"",
		"  She flowed energy into her shorted circuits.",
		"  Her blood flow and magical energy supply were unstable.",
		"  It would be difficult to construct a formula in this state.",
		"  All she could do was harden her right arm by imbuing it with as much energy as she could.",
		"Doing so turned her arm into an improvised weapon like a hammer or bat. Assuming she could manage to get into close-combat range, this was the best she could do.",
		"  All she needed now was a plan of attack.",
		"  The question wasn't what weapon to use, but how to use the weapon she had.",
		"  The simplest way would be to use the mirrors' reflections to hide and then rush the puppet from its blind spot... except for one major problem.",
		"  It did not have a sense of sight in the first place.",
		"  The puppet's view of the world around it did not stem from visual feedback, but from mapping the topography of its surroundings.",
		"  In theory, it was the same as a bat's echolocation. The environment could be measured based on the emission and return of high-frequency sound waves.",
		"  Those chants served as sensor pulses. As far as the puppet was concerned, the mirrors were no better than transparent panes, making even the thought of an ambush laughable.",
		"\"...The closer it gets, the more it's able to sense me.  I'd really rather fight it at a distance, but... if it's shooting Gandr, it's probably got at least a Finn Shot up its sleeve, too.\"",
		"  Gandr was Scandinavian in origin and, considering its simplicity, highly versatile. It was most effective at impairing a target's health by pointing a finger.",
		"  As a single-action magecraft it was limited to only causing illness, but there was a secret technique said to be the greatest mastery of the Gandr Shot...",
		"  The Finn Shot.",
		"  It could do more than cause simple illness. It was a deadly curse that could stop the heart.",
		"\"...Nnngh.\"",
		"  The wound on her back set her nerves on fire.",
		"  An unarmed girl and a deadly automaton.",
		"  It was clear that she was the one destined for death.",
		"  She considered her slim chances of survival.",
		"  When...",
		"  A vision sent chills down her spine.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Quietly, using everything she could to clamp down on the feeling, Aoko faced her all-too-familiar illusion.",
		"  She clenched her teeth to keep them from making a deafening clatter.",
		"  But there, the sensation of fingers crawling up her neck. Behind her the specter stared and laughed.",
		"  This alone made Aoko want to bolt. On top of it all, when Aoko tried to mentally simulate the coming fight, she estimated a two in ten chance of dying in the first five seconds.",
		"  ...Twenty percent. At times, her predictions were harsher than reality.",
		"  If Aoko fought the puppet ten times, she would die twice. She could not stop herself from visualizing her own corpse.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  She imagined herself collapsing, crumpling under the puppet's curse.",
		"  Her eyeballs swollen like a blowfish, blood and other fluids oozing from every bodily orifice.",
		" One in five, one in five, one in five...",
		" A one in ten chance of death was bad enough, but one in five!? It drove her crazy.",
		"\"...But...\"",
		"  Aoko forced down her heart as it tried to escape from her mouth.",
		"  Taking in a deep breath, she peered at her own reflection.",
		"  She thought back to that white night, half a year ago.",
		"  This, she decided, was nothing compared to that.",
		"  Six months ago, at the Kuonji Estate...",
		"  The hound of white roses, the Wandersnatch, that appeared from within the thick fog, had killed Aoko a hundred times out of ten. ",
		"\"Mea anima immortalis. Autem mea futura necata sunt.",
		"  Manes sum. Animam definire ambiguum est.\"",
		"  A dark curse shattered Aoko's daydream.",
		"  It was only ten meters away.",
		"  The puppet rounded the corner.",
		"  Either side stood in the shadows, their forms indistinct.",
		"  The puppet gave no warning.",
		"  Without preamble, it swiftly fired a Gandr barrage.",
		"  Just as Aoko planned, the curses fizzled out as they hit her mist-like barrier of magical energy.",
		"  The protection would only last a few seconds.",
		"  Giving her just enough time to...",
		"\"...Come on!\"",
		"  Its stretchable spear sprang toward Aoko's face!",
		"\"Bingo!\"",
		"  The lethal weapon grazed her cheek.",
		"  All her experience analyzing puppet attack patterns gave her the wherewithal to evade the attack by a hair's breadth.",
		"  It was one thing if a puppeteer were pulling the strings, but autonomous dolls had their limitations.",
		"  Aoko had bet everything on this killing machine following a predefined template. The puppet would use a given attack for a given range, and she could adjust her tactics to that.",
		"\"Now's my chance!\"",
		"  Before its arm had a chance to fully retract, she charged the puppet.",
		"  It was a risky gamble, but her overall chances were slim to begin with.",
		"  The scales tipped in her favor.",
		"  If her predictions were correct, there were two ways she would die. One was from a Finn Shot fired at that range.",
		"  And the other...",
		"  The other was if the puppet's attack pattern was beyond her ability to foresee.",
		"  Instantaneous mass transfer.",
		"Otherwise known as mass displacement.",
		"  Immediately after Aoko dodged the puppet's arm,",
		"  something smashed into her abdomen.",
		"\"GAH!\"",
		"  The head-on collision from its shoulder felt like a rocket.",
		"  But where had the ability to propel itself come from?",
		"  Puppets like this were not built to have the ability to jet around like that.",
		"\"Hah... hah...\"",
		"  Doing everything in her power to stay conscious in spite of the pain, Aoko could just make out what had happened.",
		"(It wasn't propelled, it was pulled!)",
		"  Yes. The puppet's arm had not returned to its body. It was lodged in the wall and reeled itself in from the other direction.",
		"(It... it can do that?!)",
		"  Swallowing her surprise, she hastily pulled herself back up.",
		"  Her abdomen, specifically her diaphragm, had been dealt a significant blow.",
		"The attack left her disoriented.",
		"Thankfully, the puppet was surprisingly lightweight.",
		"Her bones and organs were intact and she had sustained no life-threatening damage. She was having a hard time breathing, however.",
		"She was shaken, though she managed to keep her calm. In another two seconds, she'd be back on her feet-no, that was two seconds too long!",
		"  She told herself to calm down, that she was already calm. She'd only briefly lost her bearings, she was fine, she could recover her breath and her vision later if only her body would MOVE-",
		"\"Intellectus non necessarius est. Pius quiescat.^ O nostra essentia ablata fuit,^ratio fixa tantum est.^ Doloris initium cerebrum fuit.\"",
		"  Above her Aoko could hear the warped noise of a powerful force.",
		"\"Come on legs, move! We've got to get to... to... Where!?\"",
		"  She could once more feel the touch of death.",
		"\"<Grant us salvation.|Iis salvatio.> <Grant us salvation.|Iis salvatio.> <Grant us salvation.|Iis salvatio.>\"",
		"  The puppet was so close that Aoko could reach out and touch it.",
		"  That also meant that it could reach out and kill Aoko.",
		"(I need to get my right arm into its blind spot!)",
		"  By intuition alone Aoko rolled over to the puppet's right flank.",
		"  Its arm was still embedded within the wall.",
		"  From here it could not attack. She had made the right decision, and her dizziness faded.",
		"                      \"<Intellectus non necessarius est. Pius quiescat|Cast off righteousness. Lay piety to rest.>.",
		"                                  <  O nostra essentia ablata fuit|We beasts are meant to consume each other. Life is but a decoration.>,",
		"                    <ratio fixa tantum est. Doloris initium cerebrum fuit.|Throw away your intellect. Pain powers the mind.>\"",
		"  Aoko pulled herself back up. It was her turn.",
		"(What...?)",
		"  It was only an instant.",
		"Within this labyrinth of mirrors she saw an image of herself.",
		"                                          ",
		"\"<We die.|Iis salvatio>...\"",
		"  A blinding, brilliant light flashed.",
		"  Lacerations appeared across the walls.",
		"  At the last moment, Aoko managed to thicken the magical energy running through her veins into a primitive form of magecraft resistance. It just barely saved her life from what must have been the puppet's ace in the hole.",
		"\"Why you...!\"",
		"  The puppet bore a striking resemblance to Aoko.",
		"  This powerful curse was not satisfied with stopping Aoko's heart, but destroying her entire being.",
		"  Aoko did not even have the time to be shocked.",
		"  This was her chance for a counter-attack.",
		"  The puppet's balance was unsteady, its right arm still embedded in the wall.",
		"  Aoko prepared to give its defenseless body a strong kick, but her knees buckled and she collapsed into a heap on the floor.",
		"                \"<Vivo in somno. Solitarie putresco in inferis|In slumber, I live. In dirt, I rot, alone>.",
		"          <Hic dies meus obitus dies, et meus nativus dies. Te obeam.|Today is the day I died and was born. I come to you.>\"",
		"  A sudden nausea and light-headedness overcame Aoko.",
		"  Her body temperature began to rapidly lower.",
		"(This... whole... time... It was spreading its curses the whole time!)",
		"  She noticed too late.",
		"  The puppet's curses circled the hall.",
		"  The cursed chant that the puppet used as a source of power doubled as a defense mechanism, crippling those who drew near with illness.",
		"  She bore the full brunt the entire time she was in close proximity to it.",
		"  Although Aoko had Magic Circuits, she was succumbing just as Soujuurou had.",
		"  Languidly, she forced her deteriorating body to jump back.",
		"\"I'm not done yet!\"",
		"  With all the energy she could muster, she forced her way past the exhaustion caused by the curse.",
		"\"...Ah.\"",
		"  However, Aoko's blood pressure took a steep nose dive, not from the curse-induced anemia, but from what appeared in front of her.",
		"  They stood in perfect harmony.",
		"  In front of Aoko was the automata that shared her face, its left arm held out like an arrow.",
		"  The deadly weapon shot forward and honed in on her heart.",
		"  Then, a moment before it made contact...",
		"\"Watch out!\"",
		"  The moment she heard that fearless voice, completely out of place in this storm of violence, Aoko's body was pulled forcefully to one side.",
		"  Once again, the extending arm cut through empty air.",
		"  While puppet quickly retracted its left arm, Soujuurou took the brief opportunity to take Aoko by the hand and flee at full speed.",
		"  Soujuurou ran through the corridor as fast as he could, only stopping when he had put enough distance between them and the puppet.",
		"\"I was thinking and...\"",
		"  Though he had saved her, she looked angry rather than grateful.",
		"This did not keep Soujuurou from saying his piece.",
		"\"Tomorrow is going to be a really busy day for me, so...\"",
		"In other words, let's finish this today.",
		"  A rather awkward proposal.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Aoko remained silent.",
		"  She was also rather angry,",
		"  not that she could not figure out what made him tick,",
		"  nor because he'd returned after escaping.",
		"  Not even because he was spouting his typically airheaded lines.",
		"  ...It was, she supposed, that instant.",
		"  The fact that when he grabbed her hand, her mind had gone completely blank-Aoko found it unforgivable.",
		"  Which beckoned the response...",
		"\"Are you insane?\"",
		"  In the heat of the moment, she blurted it before she could stop herself.",
		"\"Or maybe you've got a death wish? Don't you realize that either of us could kill you with a snap of a finger?",
		"  At the very least, I don't owe you a damn thing.",
		"  Saving my life doesn't a change a thing between us.\"",
		"  Soujuurou nodded, clearly unperturbed.",
		"\"Don't worry, Aozaki. If tonight taught me anything, it's that you're more ruthless than that.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  She found herself slightly offended.",
		"\"But I think you need to get one thing straight.",
		"  That thing isn't just trying to kill you. I think it's trying to kill me as well.\"",
		"  She was having none of it.",
		"  Her eyes shot daggers his way.",
		"\"And before you chew me out, you need to know something. Do you remember the first-floor entrance at the end of that long corridor?",
		"  Well it's blocked. I tried my best to find a way out, but no luck. There was no choice but to turn right back.\"",
		"  Aoko's eyes widened ever-so slightly in amazement.",
		"  Not out of shock, but rather admiration that her enemy would go to such lengths.",
		"\"And besides, it was hostile to me too earlier. I could tell by how it was glaring at me.",
		"  ...Well, happened so fast that I didn't really get a good look at it, but it was really unsettling. You should be careful. That thing... she sure has a terrifying face.\"",
		"\"...Gee, thanks.\"",
		"\"You bet. I mean, I can't pretend like this isn't happening to me.",
		"  Whichever of you wins, I'm a dead man either way, right?\"",
		"\"...I can't argue with that. If it's willing to go as far as to seal off the entrance, then it'd probably kill any witnesses as well. At least, that's what I'd do.\"",
		"\"Right? And I don't want her to be the one who kills me.\"",
		"\"Wait, what?\"",
		"  His words were decisive.",
		"  As Aoko looked up at him, she could swear he was trying to encourage her.",
		"  It was then that she realized.",
		"  Soujuurou was looking even worse than before.",
		"\"Hey. Are you okay?\"",
		"\"Well, I'm better than if I'd drunk an entire bottle of soy sauce.\"",
		"  He tried to make light of the situation, but his forehead was clearly drenched in sweat.",
		"(Right. It's because he was close to the puppet just now.)",
		"  How could he possibly be able to withstand a curse that made even Aoko nauseous?",
		"  She bit her lip, annoyed at herself for not noticing this earlier.",
		"  Soujuurou was such an airhead that she hadn't even paused to consider his plight.",
		"\"...Why didn't you consider trying to hide down in the basement?",
		"  That would have been the safest bet, wouldn't it?\"",
		"  She really could not understand him at all.",
		"\"You should really take your own advice sometimes, Aozaki.",
		"  ...But hey, this is no time to be chatting. She could catch up at any moment.\"",
		"  He turned to look down the corridor.",
		"  The crackling sounds of a music box could be heard creeping forth from the darkness.",
		"\"I was thinking about this while I was on the first floor earlier. If it kills you, I'm next. That's why we should deal with it first.\"",
		"\"...",
		"  What are you getting at?\"",
		"  She asked a question to which she already knew the answer.",
		"  She did it to put him to the test.",
		"  If he wavered even a little, she would have killed him where he stood.",
		"\"My proposal is if I agree to help you kill that thing, will you let me go?\"",
		"\"...I thought I'd made it clear that helping me wasn't going to change my mind.",
		"And besides, what do you think you're going to do to it, anyway?\"",
		"\"Oh, that's your end of the bargain, Aozaki. This is your area of expertise, right?\"",
		"  The commander who had the overall picture was responsible for delegating roles to their teammates.",
		"  It was futile to depend on someone who was unable to grasp the situation or evaluate the enemy's strength. Soujuurou was proud to share that he knew this.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  He spoke the truth. Aoko was the only one who knew both Soujuurou and the automata.",
		"  That was why he pointed out that following her orders to the best of his ability was the only thing he could do.",
		"  It may have seemed as though Soujuurou had surrendered his capacity for self-thought, but in fact, in accepting that he was helpless he was in fact giving Aoko his complete trust.",
		"\"Fine, then. So you'll do exactly what I tell you to do?\"",
		"\"I will. And just so you know, I'm not doing this out of a sense of obligation or anything.",
		"  It's just obvious that neither of us had a chance on our own. This isn't goodwill or kindness. It's a... transaction.\"",
		"  His eyes sparkled, as if this was bartering in its truest form.",
		"\"...Oh my god.\"",
		"  This child must have learned that from Tobimaru, Aoko thought.",
		"  Though she refused to let him see it, underneath she cracked a smile.",
		"Sure, he had gotten the best of her just now, but there were times when defeat was not the worse outcome in the world.",
		"\"Honest pay for honest work. Makes sense.",
		"  And... I hate to admit it, but...\"",
		"  She relaxed her shoulders and sighed.",
		"  Her face cracked into a wicked smile, as if her fears had suddenly washed away.",
		"\"Your plan is just my style.\"",
		"  Aoko repaid Soujuurou's trust in equal measure."
