		"　……そうして。",
		"　見知らぬ部屋のベッドで目を覚ました瞬間、草十郎は大きく息を呑んだ。",
		"　アパートの安布団とは段違いのベッドの感触や、",
		"　絨毯はおろか壁紙まで高価そうな部屋の雰囲気に……ではなく。",
		"「―――、―――」",
		"　眼を白黒させたまま、こぼれかけた息を呑みこむ。",
		"　驚きの<原因|モト>はそれだ。",
		"　草十郎がぱちりと目を覚ました<傍|かたわ>らに、あの、黒衣の少女が座っていた。",
		"　物音ひとつない静寂だった。",
		"　草十郎はベッドに横になったまま少女を見つめる。",
		"　なんとなく<上半身|からだ>を起こしたい衝動にかられもしたが、真っ正面からまじまじと見るのは無遠慮かもしれない、と思いとどまった。",
		"　少女は椅子に座っているようだ。",
		"　黒い、飾り気のない服装。",
		"　そのくせ質素な印象はなく、単色なのに言いようのない気品を感じる。",
		"　高級な繊維で作られた、この少女の為の装飾―――",
		"　そんな詩的な感想を、草十郎をして抱かせるほどの。",
		"　少女は座ったままぴくりとも動かない。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　草十郎の呼吸は知らず止まっていた。",
		"　呼吸を忘れて少女に見入ったのは、純粋な驚きからだ。",
		"　ただ美しい。",
		"　その、あまりにも単純で、あんまりにも理由のない表現を同じ<人間|いきもの>に用いたのは、初めてのことだった。",
		"　純潔のまま成長した<水仙|すいせん>の花。",
		"　あるいは、夢に描かれた理想の少女像。",
		"　少女のソレは、鑑賞され、愛でられる為の美しさだ。",
		"　蒼崎青子の華やかな、生命に満ちた輝きとは違う。",
		"　なぜなら、生命あるかぎり人は老いて尽きる。",
		"　そのような結末―――幸福な完結は、この少女には許される筈がない。",
		"　それはこの<奇跡|カタチ>のまま生まれ、このカタチのまま滅び去るひとつの<寓話|ぐうわ>。",
		"　生まれながらに人間としての生を奪われた、この世ならざる命のあり方。",
		"　……<過|か><度|ど>に美しいものほど、結末は<無惨|むざん>なものになる。",
		"　山奥育ちの草十郎にとって、それは教えられるまでもなく経験している事だった。",
		"『……眠ってるみたいだ』",
		"　草十郎は誘われるように、首を横に向ける。",
		"　横顔を盗み見るのは無遠慮だと知りつつ、本能には逆らえなかった。",
		"　そうして―――",
		"「……え？」",
		"　今度こそ本当に、一瞬、心臓が止まった。",
		"　少女は眠ってなどいなかった。",
		"　無表情に、横たわる怪我人を見つめていただけだったのだ。",
		"「…………」",
		"　草十郎はベッドに横になったまま、動かした首を戻す事もできず、かといって気のきいた台詞も浮かばず、少女と無言で見つめあう。",
		"　……<華奢|きゃしゃ>な輪郭からか、自分よりいくぶん幼く見える。",
		"　反面、落ち着いた表情が年上のようにも感じさせた。",
		"　肩口までの髪はにごりのない黒。",
		"　そんな髪に合わせたように、大きめの瞳も混ざり気のない黒一色。",
		"「……………………」",
		"　少女は感情のない瞳を草十郎に向けている。",
		"　草十郎と見つめ合うカタチになっても目は逸らさない。",
		"「…………………………」",
		"　草十郎は声をかけようにもかけられない。",
		"　蛇に睨まれた蛙、という程でもないけれど、いま少女に話しかけるのは<躊躇|ためら>われた。",
		"　それに、",
		"　いかに<暢気|のんき>な草十郎でも、この少女が青子と同じ種類の<爆|にん><弾|げん>である事は身に染みて知っていた。",
		"　一方、少女は少女で<堅|かた>く口を閉ざしている。",
		"　一心に、雑念なく、横になった異邦人を看病する……ような雰囲気。",
		"　少女が何を考えているかは不明だが、草十郎にとっては辛い沈黙が続いていく。",
		"　草十郎に分かるのは、少女はこの沈黙をまったく気にしていない、という事だけ。",
		"　これでは何らかの罰ゲーム、<罰則|ペナルティ>と言えなくもない。",
		"『……。これが蒼崎の仕込みなら手がこみすぎる……』",
		"　などと思いつつも、草十郎は少女から目を離せなかった。",
		"　自分が首を戻したり目を閉じた瞬間、少女が隠し持ったナイフで自分の胸を刺すのでは……",
		"　なんて想像をかきたてられたからではない。",
		"　たしかに重苦しい沈黙で、遊園地での事を思い返すと不安になるけれど―――",
		"　それ以上に少女は魅力的だと、彼は思ったのだ。",
		"　細い体と白い肌。",
		"　人を寄せ付けない瞳の冷たさと、いまだ残った少女の面影の温かさ。",
		"　その二つが混ざりあった姿は、魔的なものと言ってもいい。",
		"『…………？』",
		"　そこまで少女と向き合って、草十郎は彼女とは以前会っているような気がした。",
		"　遊園地の一件よりもう少し前。",
		"　どこでだったかは思い出せないけれど、たしかに以前見かけた気がする。",
		"「その、いまさらだけど」",
		"　凍りついた部屋に、白々しく響く自分の声。",
		"　その場違いさに申し訳ない気持ちになりながら、草十郎は少女に語りかけた。",
		"　いつまでも見つめ合っている訳にもいかない。",
		"　……見つめ合っていると思っていたのは自分だけで、少女は睨み合っていたつもりかも知れないし。",
		"「ここはどこで、君は誰だか分かるかな」",
		"　少女は黒い瞳をかすかに細める。",
		"　気分を害した……風ではなさそうだ。",
		"「………………」",
		"　質問の返事はない。",
		"　やっぱり黙ってよう、と草十郎が思った矢先、少女は静かに片腕を上げた。",
		"「これ、あなたのでしょう」",
		"　冷たいが、唄のような声。",
		"　少女の指には白い布が<絡|から>まっている。",
		"　それが何であるかなど、草十郎には語るまでもない。",
		"　自分の持ち物を忘れるほど寝ぼけてはいなかったらしい。",
		"　無言の草十郎に、少女はふわりと布を落とした。",
		"　草十郎は布を拾い上げ、くるくると自分の首に巻く。",
		"「……青子は、それを知っているの？」",
		"　ぶしつけな問いから、草十郎は目を逸らす。",
		"　彼の頭に浮かんだのはまったく関係のない事だ。",
		"　少女は蒼崎青子を『青子』と呼んだ。",
		"　では、青子が喧嘩を売っていたのは向かいの山ではなく彼女だったのだろう、と。",
		"「さあ、どうだろう」",
		"　できるだけ真摯に、予断を<交|まじ>えず草十郎は返答する。",
		"　知るべき事と、知らなくてもいい事。",
		"　伝えるべき事と、伝わってはいけない事。",
		"　少女の言う「それ」がどちらなのか、草十郎には考えられない。ただ、",
		"「でも、その方がいいとは思うよ」",
		"　ごく自然に、少女の問いに微笑んだ。",
		"　そんな草十郎の対応に感じ入るものがあったのか、部屋を支配していた重圧は目に見えて薄れていった。",
		"　もしかすると、緊張の度合いは草十郎より少女の方が上だったのかも知れない。",
		"　……この場を支配していた少女の心の在り方が、部屋に投影されていたのなら。",
		"　緊張は消えた。",
		"　草十郎は体を起こそうとベッドに腕をたてる。",
		"　こうして話し合える以上、寝たままなのは不便だと思ったらしい。",
		"　が。起きようとした途端、体の異様なだるさに驚いてしまって、簡単には起き上がれなかった。",
		"　もぞもぞと動いて、ようやく上半身を起こすのが精一杯だ。",
		"「……あれ？　洋服のままだ」",
		"　かかっていた毛布を<剥|は>ぐなり、不思議そうに首をかしげる。",
		"「申し訳ない。こんないい布団なのに、これじゃ不釣り合いだ。……というより、勿体ない」",
		"　どうせならベッドに似合う寝間着で寝たかった、などとぼやく草十郎を、少女は意外そうに見つめている。",
		"　何か、少女にとって予想外の事をしてしまったらしい。",
		"『なんでだ。何もしてないぞ、俺』",
		"　<謂|い>われのない好奇心を向けられ、なんとなく拗ねながら草十郎は少女に体を向けた。",
		"　まだベッドの上に横たわってはいるものの、幾分ましな姿勢になっている。",
		"「それで、さっきの続きだけど」",
		"　そう、ここが何処で少女が何者なのか、まずそれを教えてもらわないと始まらない。",
		"　実際のところ、遊園地の事を思い出せば思い出すほど、そら恐ろしい想像しかできないのだが。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　そんな草十郎の決意が伝わったのか、少女も冷徹に、背中に回していた手を動かそうとした時。",
		"「…………」",
		"「…………」",
		"　またも無言で見つめ合ってしまう。",
		"　バタバタバタ。",
		"　外から響いてくる足音は、何者かが走って来るものだ。",
		"　それが誰のものか、少女はともかく草十郎にさえもありありと予測でき―――",
		"「有珠っ、約束！」",
		"　この通り。",
		"　乱暴な<一喝|いっかつ>と共に入ってきたのは予想通り、蒼崎青子その人だった。",
		"　彼女は制服姿で、長い髪をなびかせて登場した。",
		"　乱れた呼吸と不機嫌そうにつり上がった瞳が、どことなく修羅めいている。",
		"「有珠っ！」",
		"　青子にそう呼ばれた少女―――有珠はわずかに眉を<顰|ひそ>めた。",
		"　……はあ、とかため息をこぼしたのかもしれない。",
		"「早かったわね、青子」",
		"　激している青子とは正反対の落ち着いた声。",
		"　どこか白々しいのは言うまでもない。",
		"「そりゃあ、アンタの性格は知り抜いてるからね。",
		"　こういう時の短絡思考はこの二年で経験済みよ。お行儀がいいようで、面倒になったらあっさり投げ捨てるのがアンタでしょ」",
		"「いやね、人聞きの悪い」",
		"　青子の指摘を軽く受け流す有珠。",
		"　もう草十郎なんて目に入っていない、と言わんばかりの態度だった。",
		"「はん。それで今日まで何度<煮|に>え湯を飲まされたコトか。",
		"　青子に<譲|ゆず>るといったけど、よく考えると面倒だから私の方で処理しておいたわ―――なんて事<後承|いいわけ>諾、もう聞き飽きたっつーの。",
		"　短気なのはそっちの自由だけど、それなら後の始末は相方に任せるのが最低限の筋ってもんじゃないの？」",
		"「そうね。そうでなければ協闘している意味がないわ。",
		"　……まあ。今後の方針を勝手に決めた人の台詞じゃないとは思うけど」",
		"「それもきっちり片をつけたでしょう。",
		"　いい、勝ったのは<私|・><た|・><ち|・>よ。逃げ切れば見逃してあげるって言ったのは誰？　言動には責任を持ちなさい有珠。",
		"　それともなに。もしかして、一番気に食わないのはそのあたりの理由なワケ？」",
		"　む、と考えこむ有珠。",
		"　青子の詰問は、有珠自身気付いていなかったところを突いたらしい。",
		"「とにかく。",
		"　コイツの扱いは、ちゃんと目が覚めて、本人の意志でどうするか決めるまで保留ってコトで合意したでしょ。",
		"　人の留守中に出し抜くのはやめてよね」",
		"「……それ。青子、学校はどうしたの。",
		"　まだ正午になったばかりなのに」",
		"「有珠の<学|と><校|こ>が今日で<終業式|おわり>って思い出して、家庭の事情って事で早退したのよ。期末試験前だってのに、ほんと、なにやってんだか」",
		"　誰かに同意を求めるのではなく、自分自身に言い聞かせるように青子は言う。",
		"　そうして青子と有珠は見つめ合った。",
		"　いや、正しくは睨み合っている。",
		"　今まさにとっくみ合いの喧嘩が始まりそうな緊迫感だが、<第三者|そうじゅうろう>としてはなす術なく眺めているしかない。",
		"　……もっとも。",
		"　しばらく続くと思われた沈黙は、一分ほどであっさりと終わってしまった。",
		"　この程度のぶつかり合いは日常茶飯事らしい。",
		"「……わたしは居間に行っているから。",
		"　彼に事情を説明してあげて」",
		"　有珠は椅子から立ち上がり、扉へと歩きだす。",
		"　その背中を見て草十郎は首を<傾|かし>げてしまった。",
		"　有珠の手には何か、どう控えめに表現しても、",
		"『……果物、ナイフ……？』",
		"　としか言い表せない<得物|えもの>が握られていたからだ。",
		"「有珠。あえて聞くけど、その手に持ってるの、なに？」",
		"　横を通り過ぎる有珠に問いかける青子。",
		"「短剣ね、どう見ても」",
		"　有珠は無表情で返答し、スタスタと部屋から立ち去った。",
		"「……………………」",
		"　よし。今の会話に関しては深く考えないようにしよう、と自己防衛する草十郎なのだった。"

		"  Then...",
		"  Soujuurou woke up in an unfamiliar room, gasping.",
		"  Not because the plush mattress he was on was softer than his apartment's cheap futon,",
		"  or because everything from the carpet to the wallpaper looked expensive...",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Bewildered, he tried to catch his breath.",
		"  She was the cause of his surprise.",
		"  The moment Soujuurou's eyes snapped open, there she was, the girl dressed in black, sitting at his bedside.",
		"  The silence was deafening.",
		"  Still supine on the bed, Soujuurou gazed at her.",
		"  His impulse was to sit up, but he refrained, thinking it might be rude to be it staring at the person sitting next to him.",
		"  She was just sitting there, on a chair,",
		"  dressed in black, modest clothes.",
		"  Still, she projected an air that was anything but plain; her monochrome outfit evoked indescribable elegance.",
		"  Like a costume handmade just for her, from the finest fabrics.",
		"  It was enough to inspire poetic sentiments even in Soujuurou.",
		"  The girl continued to sit, completely motionless.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Without realizing it, Soujuurou had stopped breathing.",
		"  Genuine astonishment had him captivated.",
		"  Such beauty...",
		"  It was the first time he had ever thought to use such a simple, plain expression to describe another human being.",
		"  She was the daffodil, in perfect bloom.",
		"  Or the ideal female form, seen only in dreams.",
		"  This quality was something to be cherished and admired in her.",
		"  It was different from Aoko Aozaki's blindingly radiant vitality.",
		"  After all, the flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long,",
		"  and there was no way this girl would be allowed such a happy ending.",
		"  Her life was a solitary fable of someone who left the world in exactly the same way they entered it.",
		"  With her humanity stolen at birth, hers was an existence not of this world.",
		"  ...The more beautiful something was, the more tragic its fate.",
		"  Growing up in the mountains, this was not something Soujuurou was taught, but something he learned from experience.",
		"(...It looks like she's sleeping.)",
		"  Soujuurou turned his head, as though he was being lured in.",
		"  He knew it was rude to stare, but he couldn't fight his instincts.",
		"  Then...",
		"\"...Huh?\"",
		"  This time, his heart actually skipped a beat.",
		"  She was not asleep at all.",
		"  Expressionless, she was merely watching over him while he recovered.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou froze, unable to turn his head away or think of something clever to say. It was like staring into her eyes turned him to stone.",
		"  Perhaps because of her delicate features, she looked somewhat younger than him.",
		"  On the other hand, her tranquil expression made him feel like she was older.",
		"  Jet-black hair, just to her shoulders.",
		"  Her large eyes were set like onyx stones, matching her hair.",
		"\"......\"",
		"  Devoid of emotion, her gaze stayed fixed on Soujuurou.",
		"  Even after their eyes met, she did not turn away.",
		"\".........\"",
		"  He wanted to speak, but could not find the words.",
		"  It was not unlike a frog being stared down by a snake. Nevertheless he just could not bring himself to say something.",
		"  Additionally...",
		"  No matter how carefree Soujuurou might have been, he was painfully aware that this girl was as powerful as Aoko.",
		"  Less talkative, to be sure, but still powerful.",
		"  Objectively, the scene was not unlike that of someone nursing a bedridden stranger.",
		"  He had no idea what she may have been thinking about, but it seemed to him this harsh silence might last forever.",
		"  All he could say for sure was that the quiet did not appear to bother her in the slightest.",
		"  It was like some bizarre form of punishment.",
		"(...If this is some kind of test from Aozaki, it sure is elaborate.)",
		"  He thought, keeping his eyes on the girl.",
		"  He felt like the moment he turned his head or blinked, she might stab him in the chest with a hidden blade...",
		"  ...and not because his imagination was running away with him.",
		"  In the stifling silence, it was only natural that Soujuurou would think back on what had happened in the amusement park, and it made him uneasy.",
		"  But stronger than any anxiety was his fascination with the girl.",
		"  Her slender frame and milky white skin...",
		"  The chill of her guarded stare, the warmth of her lingering femininity...",
		"  It was the mixture of those two latter qualities that was almost magical.",
		"(...?)",
		"  He stared at her for so long, he began to get the feeling that they had met somewhere before.",
		"  Sometime before the conflict at Kitsy Land...",
		"  He could not quite put his finger on it, but he was sure he had seen her previously.",
		"\"Um, I don't know if this is the right time to ask this, but...\"",
		"  His voice shattered the frozen silence in the room.",
		"  He almost felt sorry for making noise as he spoke out to her.",
		"  But they could not very well just sit and stare at each other forever.",
		"  ...Though, he might have been the only one thinking they were \"staring,\" and perhaps she thought they were \"glaring\" at each other.",
		"\"Where am I, and who might you be?\"",
		"  She narrowed her eyes slightly,",
		"  though apparently, not out of offense.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  There was no response.",
		"  Just as he was thinking it would have been better to keep quiet, she quietly raised her hand.",
		"\"This is yours, is it not?\"",
		"  Her voice was  cold, but melodic .",
		"  A white piece of cloth was wrapped in her fingers.",
		"  There was no need to tell him what it was.",
		"  He was conscious enough to recognize his own possessions.",
		"  Soujuurou sat speechless as she tossed it to him.",
		"  Picking it up, he wrapped it around his neck.",
		"\"...Does Aoko know about that?\"",
		"  He looked away in response to her blunt question,",
		"  distracted by something unrelated.",
		"  She called Aoko Aozaki by her given name,",
		"  which led him to believe that the mountain Aoko had argued with in his dream was actually the girl beside him.",
		"\"I'm not sure.\"",
		"  As sincerely as he could, he answered without presumption.",
		"  There are things that should be known, and things that need not be.",
		"  There are also things that should be told, and other things that must not be.",
		"  Soujuurou was not exactly sure what \"that\" she was referring to. However...",
		"\"But, maybe it's better that way.\"",
		"  He smiled slightly at her question.",
		"  Perhaps impressed by his response, the overwhelming pressure in the room dissipated noticeably.",
		"  Or maybe she had been more nervous than he was the entire time,",
		"  projecting the image that his room was her domain a tad too strongly.",
		"  The tension faded.",
		"  Soujuurou tried to sit up and prop his arms beneath him.",
		"  Now that they were talking, it seemed awkward to stay lying down.",
		"  However, his body felt strange as he tried to move, and it surprised him how difficult it was to sit up.",
		"  It took everything he had just to raise his upper body to a sitting position.",
		"\"...Huh? I'm still in my clothes.\"",
		"  As he threw the covers back, he tilted his head quizzically.",
		"\"I'm sorry. This is such a nice bed, too. I shouldn't be in my clothes under the sheets. What a waste of a good bed.\"",
		"  She stared at him, not expecting him to complain about not wearing pajamas while sleeping.",
		"  Somehow, it appeared that he had done something to surprise her.",
		"(But why? I didn't do anything.)",
		"  Pouting a bit at the unwarranted curiosity, he turned to face her.",
		"  Although he was still mostly laying down, it was at least a more dignified position.",
		"\"So... any chance you'll tell me...?\"",
		"  Indeed, he needed to find out where he was and who she was before anything else.",
		"  Actually, the more he thought about what happened at the amusement park, the more he got a sinking feeling in his stomach.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Perhaps finally getting through to her, she calmly moved her arm from behind her back, when...",
		"\"...\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Once again, they silently locked eyes.",
		"  Thump, thump, thump.",
		"  There was a startling sound of rapidly approaching footsteps.",
		"  They both had a pretty good idea of who it was.",
		"\"Alice! You promised!\"",
		"  Just as expected.",
		"  Aoko Aozaki burst through the door with a thunderous roar.",
		"  She entered wearing her school uniform, her long hair flowing behind her.",
		"  Her breathing was heavy and her forehead was wrinkled by a scowl, granting her a demonic appearance.",
		"\"Alice!\"",
		"  This girl named Alice scowled slightly in response.",
		"  She may have even let a sigh of disappointment slip out.",
		"\"Aoko. Home early, I see.\"",
		"  Her calm voice was the polar opposite of Aoko's.",
		"  Needless to say, her voice dripped with a brazen coldness.",
		"\"That's because I know you all too well.",
		"  Over the past two years, I've come to expect how quickly you jump to conclusions. You might act mild-mannered, but as soon as things don't go your way, the veil drops.\"",
		"\"Oh dear, you make it sound so scandalous.\"",
		"  Effortlessly, she brushed aside Aoko's jab.",
		"  In doing so, Soujuurou had the distinct impression that she no longer even realized he was in the room.",
		"\"Ha! Let the record show that I've lost count of how many times you've gone back on your word.",
		"  I'm tired of hearing the same old story after the fact: 'I know I said I would leave it to you, but after careful consideration I decided to take care of it myself.'",
		"  I may have come to terms with your short fuse, but the least you can do in return is to trust your partner to set things right, no?\"",
		"\"You're right. We wouldn't be partners otherwise.",
		"  Though... you're hardly one to talk, after unilaterally deciding our plan from here on out.\"",
		"\"We've been over this already.",
		"  We won, okay! Besides, who was the one who said we should let him live if he escaped? Yet again you've gone back on your word, Alice.",
		"  Oh, don't tell me. Next you'll be saying *that's* the reason you can't let sleeping dogs lie!\"",
		"  Alice frowned slightly and fell silent.",
		"  Her housemate seemed to have struck a nerve that Alice herself did not know was there.",
		"\"Anyway...",
		"  We agreed to decide what to do with him when he wakes up, after hearing him out, right?",
		"  So stop trying to flip the script every time my back's turned.\"",
		"\"...Speaking of which, aren't you supposed to be at school?",
		"  It's noon already.\"",
		"\"I remembered you only had your school's end-of-term ceremony today, so I told them I had to leave early for personal reasons. This is so warped. I have finals coming up, for goodness' sake.\"",
		"  Aoko grumbled, more to herself than anyone else in the room.",
		"  Then, she locked eyes with Alice.",
		"  Or more accurately, they glared daggers at each other.",
		"  The room had become tense once again, and it felt like a fight could break out at any moment. With no way to escape, Soujuurou had no choice but to sit and watch.",
		"  But then...",
		"  The electric silence that seemed like it would last forever suddenly broke about a minute later.",
		"  Apparently this sort of clash was an everyday occurrence.",
		"\"...I'll be in the drawing room.",
		"  Explain the circumstances to him.\"",
		"  Alice stood up from the chair and made for the door.",
		"  Watching her go, Soujuurou cocked his head.",
		"  In her hand was what could only be described as...",
		"(...A fruit knife?)",
		"  He had no other words to describe the tool she was clutching.",
		"\"Alice. I hate to ask, but what's in your hand?\"",
		"  Aoko asked Alice as she walked past.",
		"\"A dagger, what else?\"",
		"  Alice answered expressionlessly, before briskly walking out of the room.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou thought it best to not think too deeply about the scene he had just witnessed."
