		"　遊園地と外を分ける境界線に向かって、青子たちは走り続ける。",
		"　行く手を阻むオブジェの数は減ってきていた。",
		"　<外|そ><界|と>に通じる東側の鉄柵まで、あと三百メートル弱。",
		"　幸運な事に、鉄柵への道中にはこれといって巨大な建物はない。",
		"　あの観覧車に立ち<塞|ふさ>がられたらそれこそ終わりだが、観覧車が動き出すまであと幾ばくかの<猶予|ゆうよ>があるようだ。",
		"　現れるのは青子の簡易魔術で吹き飛ばせる程度のオブジェのみ。",
		"“これなら、なんとか―――”",
		"　鉄柵まで辿り着ける、と青子は呼吸を整える。",
		"　遊園地に満ちている<魔力|マナ>を使用しているので、青子本人の魔力はほぼ満タン。",
		"　<身体|からだ>の魔術回路は調子をあげる一方だし、一度ぐらいは全開で魔術行使をしてもいいぐらいだ。",
		"「―――？」",
		"　と。",
		"そんな青子の視界上空に、なにやら系統の違うモノが浮遊していた。",
		"　それは草十郎のななめ上空に張りつき、三メートルの高さを維持したまま移動している。",
		"「静希君、ちょっと」",
		"「ああ。さっきから付いてきてる」",
		"　青子より先に気づいていたのか、草十郎はイヤそうに上空を盗み見ていた。",
		"　なにしろ自分にぴったりとくっついて来ているのだ。気にならない方がおかしい。",
		"　浮遊物は大きさにして直径一メートルほど。",
		"　表面のタイルには<十|と><重|え><二|は><十|た><重|え>に廻る光の躍動。",
		"「……卵、かな」",
		"　草十郎は自信なさげに呟いた。",
		"「卵……？　卵って言ったら―――割れる卵！」",
		"　<衛星|たまご>はゴムのように魔弾を弾く。",
		"　その特性―――干渉を当然のように無効化するのは、間違いなく“<童話の怪物|プロイキッシャー>”……！",
		"「やっぱり外からのルールじゃ壊れないか……",
		"　静希君、アレから絶対に目をそらさないで！",
		"　いい、何があっても見続けること！　視界の<隅|すみ>に入れとくだけでいいから！」",
		"「あ、ああ!?」",
		"　草十郎に指示をだしながら、青子は走る速度を速める。",
		"　……アレは文字通り、割れる卵だ。",
		"　塀の上に乗った卵人間。",
		"　何をしても、何を言っても決して落ちる事はないが、目を離した途端に落下して破片をまき散らす。",
		"「曰く、王様の軍隊でも元に戻せない数の破片―――」",
		"　それがマザーグースに唄われるハンプティ・ダンプティの一節だ。",
		"　あの卵の標的が草十郎なら、草十郎が卵から視線をきった瞬間、落下して爆発する……！",
		"「……まあ、爆発するかどうかは知らないけど」",
		"　どうあれ、厄介なモノをまき散らすに違いない。",
		"　卵という形状、錠門の装飾、刻まれた詩文も気になる。",
		"　アレが卵ならいつかは<孵|かえ>る。",
		"　ずっと見続けていても、時間がくれば“中身が出る”としたら、ますます余力を残している場合ではない。",
		"「蒼崎、速すぎないか!?",
		"　あんまり全力で走ると―――」",
		"「後の事は考えないで！",
		"　いいから静希君は卵だけに集中して―――」",
		"　卵の出現にあわせて、ここぞとばかりに立ちふさがるブレッドマン。",
		"「邪魔―――！」",
		"　かつてない大軍で押し寄せる焼きたてパンを、",
		"　青子はこれまで以上の火力でなぎ払うのだが―――",
		"「っ、<堅|かた>焼きか、この―――！」",
		"　<弾く|スナップ>が効かないというのなら、刻印を用いた魔弾を放つ。",
		"　<術式|だんがん>を用いた<風圧甲弾|ドロウ>。",
		"　先ほどまでのが機関銃の掃射なら、これは大砲の一撃だ。",
		"　<魔力|スナップ>に耐えきった堅焼きパンたちは、<魔術|ドロウ>の<奔流|ほんりゅう>を受けて焼き千切れていった。",
		"「うわ……」",
		"　もちろん、破壊はブレッドマンだけに留まらない。",
		"　レンガの道は舗装をふっ飛ばされ丸裸にされ、",
		"　近くにあった売店は鉄骨だけを残した<骸骨|スケルトン>と化していた。",
		"　ブレッドマンの壁より青子の破壊活動の方がいずれ行く手を阻むのでは、と草十郎でなくとも不安に思う惨状である。",
		"「ちょっと。なんで距離とるのよ、そこ。<傍|そば>にいないと危ないじゃない。",
		"　ほら、もっとこっち！",
		"　言っとくけどアンタがアイツらに囲まれちゃったらアウトよ？　私、人質とか意味ないタイプだし。そもそも区別して撃つとか、そういうのできないし」",
		"　なるほど、と頷く草十郎。",
		"　人質は意味をなさない、という言葉の意味は分からずとも、彼女の言わんとするところは分かる。",
		"「つまり、今はどこであろうと危険なのか」",
		"「……アンタね」",
		"　草十郎の相変わらずの天然っぷりにカチンときながらも、青子は少しだけ感心した。",
		"　草十郎はいたって真面目だ。",
		"　彼の視線は、今の乱戦の中でもしっかり頭上の卵に向けられている。",
		"「その分なら安心か。",
		"　物分かりは悪いけど、一度言われた事はきっちり守るあたり、貴方のいいところよね」",
		"「そんなことより蒼崎。俺の気のせいならいいんだけど、さっきのパン、堅くなかったか？」",
		"「……まあね。アイツら、少しずつ強くなってきてるわ。",
		"　大量生産が軌道に乗ったんで、今度はクオリティアップをテーマにしたのかも」",
		"「静希君でもお察しの通り、ここからは手強くなっていく一方よ。あのパンたちでさえ個体差がでてきたみたいだし。",
		"　考えたくないけど、そのうちジャム塗ったりレタス乗っけたり、はては合体したりして」",
		"　冗談を言いながらも青子の目は真剣だ。",
		"　容赦なく悪化していく状況に、草十郎は今更ながら戦慄を覚えてしまう。",
		"「じゃあ、そのうちミラーハウスの人形ぐらいに恐くなるのか、あいつら？」",
		"「間違いなくね。そこまで<高価|レア>なパンになったら私も自分だけで手一杯になる。ところで静希君、ああいうのとケンカできる？」",
		"　ぶんぶん、と草十郎は心底イヤそうな顔で首を振る。",
		"「でしょ？　なら急ぎましょ。色々余裕ないんだから」",
		"　青子は短く深呼吸をして、駆け足を再開する。",
		"　視界<遥|はる>か、霧の向こうの鉄柵まであと三百メートルほど。",
		"　……このまま何事もなければ無事にたどり着けるかもしれない。",
		"　そんな都合のいい希望を抱きながら、草十郎は青子の後に続いていった。"

		"  Aoko and Soujuurou continued their dash toward the boundary separating the park from outside.",
		"  The curio horde that stood in their way had reduced in number.",
		"  The iron fence that separated the two from the outside world was just less than three hundred meters away.",
		"  Fortunately, there were no particularly large buildings barring their path.",
		"  If the Ferris wheel had stood in their way, that would have spelled the end, but thankfully, it had yet to reach its full strength.",
		"  The only things that appeared before them were weak oddities that could easily be handled by Aoko's simple magecraft.",
		"\"At this rate, we just might...\"",
		"  She would have said \"make it to the fence\" if her lungs would only allow it.",
		"  Since Aoko was utilizing the ample mana filling the park, her tank of magical energy was nearly full.",
		"  Coupled with the fact that the condition of her body's circuits was steadily improving to the extent that she would be able to unleash at least one all-out onslaught.",
		"\"...?\"",
		"  Until...",
		"Above her field of vision, something unusual was hovering.",
		"  It was locked on Soujuurou, hovering three meters above him over to one side.",
		"\"Shizuki! Look!\"",
		"\"What? That thing? It's been on us for a while.\"",
		"  Soujuurou had seemingly noticed it before Aoko, hence his previous awkward glances toward the sky.",
		"  In truth, it would have been stranger for him not to notice as the thing was practically glued to him.",
		"  In terms of its size, the floating object measured about one meter in diameter.",
		"  Tiles covered its exterior, about which a multitude of spinning lights danced about.",
		"\"Is that an... egg?\"",
		"  Soujuurou asked, not really sure what to call it.",
		"\"An egg? If it's an egg, then that means it'll crack!\"",
		"  Her bullets bounced off like it was made of rubber.",
		"  That trait―the ability to deflect all outside interference―confirmed to Aoko that this thing was undoubtedly a Ploy Kickshaw.",
		"\"Knew it. I can't break its rules from the outside.",
		"  Shizuki, don't take your eyes off it even for a second!",
		"  No matter what happens, keep your eyes locked on it! Even if it's just in the corner of your vision!\"",
		"\"O-Okay?\"",
		"  Aoko picked up her pace as she barked orders.",
		"  The egg man who sat on a wall...",
		"  He would crack, just as the tale spoke of.",
		"  Nothing anyone could do or say would cause him to fall, but the moment they stopped looking, he would tumble down and break into pieces.",
		"\"'All the king's horses and all the king's men could put him back together again.' Or so it's said.\"",
		"  It was the Mother Goose poem, Humpty Dumpty.",
		"  If Soujuurou was its target, then the moment he averted his gaze, it would tumble and explode.",
		"\"Except for the exploding part. Who knows what'll happen when it falls.\"",
		"  Either way, it was going to scatter something troublesome when it fell.",
		"  Its oval shape, the keyhole adorning the front, and writing inscribed upon it... They all made her anxious.",
		"  If it was an egg, that meant it was going to hatch at some point.",
		"  Even if he continued his stare, once the time came for whatever was inside to come out, they would have even less ability to conserve their energy.",
		"\"Aozaki, slow down, would you!",
		"  If you use up all of your energy now, you'll―\"",
		"\"Forget about what comes next!",
		"  Just focus on watching that egg!\"",
		"  At this critical juncture, bread-men stepped out to join the egg and block their path.",
		"\"Out of the way!\"",
		"  The bread-men were marching forth in a grand battalion.",
		"  At her level of firepower, Aoko should have easily mowed them down. However...",
		"\"These have hard crusts? Take this!\"",
		"  If Snap failed to do the job, that meant it was time for her to put her crest to use.",
		"  Draw: a formula-triggered bullet encased in a full wind jacket.",
		"  If her previous shots were the equivalent of a machine gun volley, then this was her artillery shot.",
		"  The hard-crust bread that had absorbed her Snap without a dent scattered into thousands of tiny pieces at her Draw's torrent.",
		"\"Whoa...\"",
		"  Of course, the destruction did not end with just the bread men.",
		"  Sending bricks flying, the previously paved road was now bare.",
		"  The nearby stall had turned into a skeleton of steel beams.",
		"  It was a spectacle that made Soujuurou question which force, the wall of bread men or Aoko's ability to lay waste to things, would obstruct their path more.",
		"\"Hey! Don't wander off! It's dangerous if you don't stick close to me!",
		"  Come on, get closer!",
		"  We're out of strikes, you know? If they surround you, you're a goner! You should know, hostages don't mean squat to me, and it's not like I can pick out my targets precisely anyway!\"",
		"  This made a lot of sense to Soujuurou.",
		"  He had not fully appreciated the part about hostages, but he got the gist of it.",
		"\"So basically, I'm in danger no matter where I stand.\"",
		"\"You...\"",
		"  Offended though she was by his typical naive response, she could not help but be impressed.",
		"  Soujuurou was a straight arrow through and through.",
		"  His eyes stayed firmly focused on the egg overhead, even amidst the chaos of the melee unfolding before him.",
		"\"I don't know why I worried.",
		"  You may not be the sharpest tool, but you sure are good at following orders.\"",
		"\"One thing, Aozaki. Was I imagining things, or did those bread men seem tougher than before?\"",
		"\"...No, you weren't imagining that. They're getting stronger.",
		"  They must have nailed down their mass-production process, so they've turned their attention to upping the quality.\"",
		"\"As you figured out already, they're just going to get tougher as we go. It seems like even those bread guys have started to develop individuality.",
		"  I hate to think about it, but they might start spreading themselves with jelly, or wearing other fillings and merging with one another.\"",
		"  Though she was joking, her eyes were dead serious.",
		"  Soujuurou shuddered at the thought of the situation growing even more dire.",
		"\"So you're saying that those guys are going to become as terrifying as the puppet from the house of mirrors soon?\"",
		"\"Oh, you can count on it. And I'll have my hands full with bread that rare. Say, Shizuki. Think you can handle yourself against one of those?\"",
		"  Soujuurou shook his head, a look of complete aversion upon his face.",
		"\"I didn't think so. So let's get moving, we can't afford to hang around here.\"",
		"  Aoko took a quick, deep breath, then began to sprint once again.",
		"  Far in the distance, through the fog, the iron fence waited, three hundred meters away.",
		"  As long as nothing happened, they would make it there in one piece.",
		"  Soujuurou followed after Aoko, holding onto that all-too convenient hope."
