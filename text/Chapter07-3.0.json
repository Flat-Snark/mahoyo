		"　二日目の期末試験が終わって、草十郎はひとり洋館への帰路についた。",
		"　坂道は上に行くほど傾斜を増していき、森も深さを増していく。",
		"　それが二十分以上も続くのだから、地域住人たちにとって久遠寺邸のある丘は山以外の何物でもない。",
		"　一方、草十郎にすれば歩くだけで踏破できる森を山と呼ぶには抵抗がある。",
		"　舗装された道があり、",
		"　日射しで方角を確かめられる程度の森であり、",
		"　急な斜面も、<茂|しげ>みに<潜|ひそ>む動物の姿もない。",
		"　ここでは遭難の恐れはおろか、迷う事を心配する必要もないのだから。",
		"「……情けない。まだ未練ばっかりだ」",
		"　知らず知らずのうち回想していた自分を、草十郎は静かに罵倒した。",
		"　町に引っ越してきてからの数週間は、山と町を比較してばかりだった。",
		"　その時はこんな風に自分を叱る事もなかったが、",
		"　ここ数日―――蒼崎青子と知り合ってからは、それが後ろ向きだという事にようやく気が付いたのだ。",
		"　理由、理念はどうあれ立ち止まらない少女。",
		"　その姿を目で追ううちに、自分も自然と早足になっていたらしい。",
		"　その青子が住む洋館は、活き活きとした彼女には不釣り合いな<趣|おもむき>だ。",
		"　三咲町の中でも<一際|ひときわ>異彩な建物。",
		"　幽霊屋敷と呼ばれる洋館。",
		"　実際住んでいるのは幽霊ではなく魔法使いなのだけど、どっちもどっちなので、世論というのはわりと正しいのかもしれない。",
		"「……そう言えば。幽霊と魔法使いっていうのは、どっちが常識はずれなんだろう？」",
		"　都会の生活に慣れていない自分を棚に上げて、草十郎ははて、と首をひねる。",
		"　ともあれ、どちらにしてもやるべき事は変わらない。",
		"　期末試験は明日で終わりだ。",
		"　青子が責任持って草十郎を保護する、といったリミットまであとわずか。",
		"　可能であるなら今日のうちに、草十郎は洋館の主に同居人として認められなくてはいけない。",
		"　館をぐるりと囲む木々の隙間、自然の並木道を通って、草十郎は玄関まで歩いていく。",
		"「――――――よし」",
		"　玄関の前で一度だけ深呼吸をし、草十郎は館内へと入っていった。",
		"　目指すは有珠がいるであろう居間である。",
		"　しかし。",
		"　そんな草十郎を迎えたのは、予想外の光景だった。",
		"　少し歩いて、玄関から館のホールであるロビーに辿り着く。",
		"　そのロビーにひとつ、大きな違和感がある。",
		"　中世の城を思わせる洋館のロビー。",
		"　人工の明かりは一切なく、冬の肌寒い日射しが、さあ、と天窓から影を落としている。",
		"　緑薫る、木製のタイル。",
		"　四角い大樹によりそう黒衣。",
		"　少女は文字通り、洋館に体を預けている。",
		"　母親の子守歌か、穏やかな揺りかごか。",
		"　洋館は少女の眠りを守るように、空気のざわめきさえ飲みこんでいた。",
		"　館の影で眠る少女。",
		"　余人の目から隠された有珠の姿は、このロビーで最も鮮明に、見る者を魅了する。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　草十郎は当惑から、つい天井をあおいでしまった。",
		"　……だって、不意打ちにも程がある。",
		"　少女は暖炉の傍で、その細い体を預けて眠っている。",
		"　いかに美しい絵画のようでも、この状況は心臓に悪い。",
		"　……命を感じさせない眠り。",
		"　あまりにも静かで、取り除くもののないカタチ。",
		"　この寒空の下、冷たい柱にしなだれているのに、彼女は幸福に包まれていた。",
		"　死という名の永眠を、見る者に思わせてしまうほどの。",
		"「……寒くないのかな、この子は」",
		"　ぼんやりと有珠を眺めながら、ぽつりと呟く。",
		"　毛布でも持ってくる……なんて気の利いた案を、彼は微塵も考えなかった。",
		"　代わりに思いついた事は、なぜか、ふたり分のお茶を淹れる事だった。",
		"　静かにドアを開けて居間に移動する。",
		"　テーブルの上には三粒の錠剤。",
		"　毎日帰ってきたら飲むように、と青子から言われている薬である。",
		"　わずかに甘い錠剤を飲みこんで台所に足を運び、数ある紅茶の箱からひとつを選んで、ふたり分の紅茶を淹れる。",
		"　そうしてロビーに戻ってみても、少女は眠ったままだった。",
		"　物音に少しだけ気を配って床に腰を下ろす。",
		"　ズボン越しに伝わってくる床の<感触|つめたさ>にビックリする。",
		"　暖炉の<傍|そば>なら温かいのでは、と考えもしたが、青子曰く、あの暖炉は無用の長物とかなんとか。",
		"　青子も有珠も手入れの仕方を知らないらしい。",
		"　草十郎は盆に載せたティーカップを有珠と自分の前に置くと、おもむろに鞄から古典の教科書を取り出した。",
		"「……蒼崎、怒ってたからな」",
		"　今朝の青子の顔を思い出して、つい独白する。",
		"　彼女が怒っていた理由も、あの一瞬の顔もまったく意味不明のままだ。",
		"　それはそれとして、明日にそなえて復習をしなくてはいけない事だけはハッキリしていた。",
		"　青子のおかげで今日のテストは幾分ましになったけれど、明日の科目はさらに難敵だ。",
		"　今朝から怒っている彼女が今夜も手伝ってくれるとは思えない。",
		"「そのくせ点数悪いと怒るし。別に、蒼崎が怒る筋合いじゃないと思う」",
		"　文句を言いつつ教科書を開く。",
		"　有珠の目が覚めるまで、そうやって待つつもりらしい。",
		"　ホールにはページをめくる音だけが響いていく。",
		"　時計の針も、森のざわめきも届かない<午睡|ごすい>。",
		"　……数時間が経って、草十郎は静かに立ち上がった。",
		"　ロビーに差しこむ日射しは、白から赤に変わりつつある。",
		"「そろそろバイトの時間か」",
		"　固まった背筋を伸ばして、草十郎はちらりと有珠を見た。",
		"　眠りは変わらず穏やかだ。",
		"「………………」",
		"　む、と草十郎は真剣に眉をよせる。",
		"　このまま寝かせておいていいのか、有珠の日常を知らない彼には悩みどころだ。",
		"「……いや。蒼崎も帰ってくるだろうし、いらぬ世話かな」",
		"　いかなる思考が生み出した結論か、草十郎はひとり頷いて洋館を後にした。",
		"　今日のバイト先は三咲町商店街にある、中華飯店まっどべあである。",
		"　その制服は、輝かんばかりの色彩センスで作られていた。",
		"　オレンジ一色のエプロンにはデフォルメされた白熊が一頭、その強靱な爪で中華鍋を<爆砕|ばくさい>している。",
		"　三咲町周辺では他の追随を許さないほど独創的な、山岳地帯の標識と見まがうデザインだ。",
		"　ここは中華飯店まっどべあ。",
		"　地域密着型の、名前とロゴ以外はどこにでもある大衆食堂。",
		"　近年増えはじめているファミリーレストランに押されはじめているものの、食事処として日々絶賛営業中の老舗である。",
		"　近隣住民との触れ合いを大切にする彼らは、サービスの一環として出張配達も行っていた。",
		"　人呼んで『<Ｑ|クイック>　<Ｋ|キラー>　<Ｓ|サービス>　・森のクマさん』。",
		"　現在、草十郎のおもな仕事はその出前役である。",
		"　自転車で宅配が可能な三咲丘周辺は彼の受け持ちで、出前先が遠くなると先輩方の愛車・万能50ccキングサーモン号の出番となるがどうでもいい。",
		"「<社木|やしろぎ>のダチから聞いたんだけどな」",
		"　出前待機中の配達人は、暇さえあればウェイターと洗い物を一身に引き受ける。",
		"　今日はまだ夕飯時になっていないので、宅配専門の彼らは厨房で仲良く皿洗いをしていた。",
		"「聞いてるか、静希」",
		"「聞いてるよ、木乃美」",
		"　学生バイトである彼らは大きな流し台に両手をつっこんだまま、熱心に仕事をしている……フリをしながら話しこんでいる。",
		"「和食のケニヤだけじゃねえんだってよ。三咲町の<大帝都|だいていと>にもメシアンにもその手の注文があったらしいぜ。",
		"　そんなに肉がほしいなら<下市|したいち>に行けばいいのにな。なんだって、生肉だの大物の鮭まるごとだのを出前させやがるのか。",
		"　どうよ。こう、露骨にやばそうな話じゃねえ？　ワニとかアザラシでも飼ってるんじゃねえかな、そいつ」",
		"「他に比べてみると、たしかに珍しい話だと思う。ところで木乃美、ワニってなんだ？」",
		"「ワニはワニだろー。だっせぇ、実物見たコトないのかよー。まあオレもねえけどな。",
		"　んー、今度がくがく動物ランドのアフリカ特集ビデオを貸してやるから、見とけよ」",
		"　木乃美も慣れたもので、草十郎への対応が板に付いてきている。",
		"　そんなとりとめのない会話をしていると、出前の注文を告げる電話が鳴った。マネージャーが素早く受話器を取り、注文と住所を確認する。",
		"　受話器が置かれると、厨房に集まっている宅配者たちはみんなそっぽを向いた。",
		"　この寒空の中、風をきって出前に行くのは誰だって嫌なものだ。",
		"「静希くん。ちょっと遠いけど、配達お願い」",
		"　そんな根性無しのアルバイターたちに失望する様子もなく、マネージャーは草十郎へ声をかけた。",
		"「はいこれ、届けるもののリスト。異例だからあまり他のバイトには他言しないようにね」",
		"　マネージャーの手には注文と住所を書き留めたメモ用紙が一枚。",
		"　それを受け取って、草十郎は静かに顔をしかめた。",
		"「マネージャー」",
		"「なんだい？」",
		"　言いたい事は分かっている、とばかりにマネージャーは草十郎を見つめ返す。",
		"「君の疑問はもっともだ。しかし、まあ、長いことこの商売をやっていると、時にはこんな馬鹿な話が転がってくる事もある。そうおかしなコトじゃない。",
		"　じゃ、冷蔵庫から品物持ってくるから」",
		"　ごく自然に厨房を後にする黒服のマネージャーの姿を、なるほど、と感心して草十郎は眺めた。",
		"　どんな所でも、おかしな話はあるものらしい。",
		"「遅いっ！」",
		"　午後十時過ぎ。",
		"　アルバイトを終え、ちょっとした寄り道をしてきた草十郎を迎えたのは、ごらんの通り、<怒|いか>れる蒼崎青子だった。",
		"　目に見えて不機嫌そうな彼女を見て、草十郎はホッと胸をなで下ろす。",
		"　青子がなぜ怒っているのか不明だが、今朝の分かりづらい怒りとは別種のものだったからだ。",
		"「遅いって、まだ十時になったばかりだろう。",
		"　どうしたんだ、蒼崎」",
		"　両手に抱えたダンボールを床に下ろしながら、草十郎は暖炉のあたりに視線を向ける。",
		"　ひとり眠っていた少女の姿はない。",
		"「違うわ。もう十時になった、の間違いでしょ。",
		"　アンタってほんと、自分がどんな状態にあるか分かってないのね」",
		"「？」",
		"「いいから、居間に来て」",
		"　首を傾げる草十郎をよそに、青子はスタスタと居間へと歩いて行く。",
		"　ダンボール箱を抱え直し、草十郎もいそいそと後に続く。",
		"　草十郎はコートを脱いで、コートハンガーに掛けながら居間に入った。",
		"　有珠は自室に引きこもっているようだ。",
		"　テーブルの上にはお馴染みの錠剤が置かれている。",
		"「……説明しなかった私も悪いけど、貴方も帰ってくる時間は守ってよね。こっちはそのつもりで作ってるんだから」",
		"　はい、とテーブル上の錠剤と、水の入ったコップを差しだす青子。",
		"「？　薬なら出かける前に飲んだけど。",
		"　体の調子だって悪くないし、そんなにあわてるコトか？」",
		"「は？　なんだって私たちがアンタの健康気にかけなくちゃいけないのよ」",
		"「勘違いしてるようだけど、アンタが帰ってくる度に飲んでるのって、平たく言えば毒よ？",
		"　速効性じゃないから効き目は半日すると出てくるんだけど、その前に新しい<錠剤|どくやく>を飲んでおかないと、古い毒が体に回ってばったり逝くって寸法ね。",
		"　有珠のヤツ、これぐらいしないと信用できないって言い張ったのよ」",
		"「ほら、分かったらさっさと飲む。",
		"　……ま、私もこれ、面倒だと思うし。",
		"　近いうちもっと形のある方法を考えてみるから、それまでこの方法で我慢して」",
		"「……言ってる事は支離滅裂だが、とにかく今までよくない物を飲んでたんだな？」",
		"　青子から錠剤を受け取って、草十郎は一口で飲みこんだ。",
		"　毒物だと聞いて<怯|ひる>んだ素振りもない。",
		"　どうも、青子たちの横暴を非難する気はないらしい。",
		"「まったく。毒をもって毒を制するなんて、また古風な真似するな、蒼崎も有珠も」",
		"　笑いのツボに入ったらしく、草十郎は頬を<緩|ゆる>ませる。",
		"　一方、青子的には、どうしてそこで笑うのかまったくもって理解不能なのだった。",
		"「今日帰りが遅れたのは、アパートまで荷物を取りにいっていたからなんだ。そういうコトなら、電話のひとつでもすればよかった」",
		"「……荷物って、まさかそれじゃないでしょうね」",
		"　持ってきたダンボール箱を指差され、草十郎はもちろん、と頷く。",
		"「住んでいないのに家賃を払うのは馬鹿らしいから、今日で引き上げてきた。いちおう、いつでも戻れるように話はつけてあるから、三ヶ月ぐらいは大丈夫だよ」",
		"「家賃……？",
		"　あ、そっか。そうよね、",
		"私ってばなんでそんな事を忘れてたんだろう。有珠が聞いたら喜ぶわ、そりゃ」",
		"　華のような笑顔、とはこのコトか。",
		"　一点の曇りもない、ズバリ、新しい<悪巧|わるだく>みを思いついた子供のような笑顔である。",
		"　不吉なコトこの上ない、と来るべき脅威に震える草十郎だった。",
		"「けど随分少ないのね、荷物。ダンボール一箱分しかないの？」",
		"「そうかな、十分多いだろ。それより有珠は自室か？」",
		"「ちょっと前に戻ったわ。珍しく食後もここに残ってたんだけど、待ちきれなかったみたいね」",
		"　青子は不敵な笑顔のまま、意味ありげな視線を草十郎に投げかける。",
		"「待ちきれなかったって、何を」",
		"「そりゃあ、有珠が眠ってるのをいいことに在庫のないフォションとブルーキャリコを勝手に使ってくれた、どこかの誰かさんにお仕置きするためなんじゃない？」",
		"「フォション……って、あのお茶の葉？」",
		"「そう。私もびっくりしたけどね。有珠がどっかで寝入るのはよくある事だけど、紅茶を用意して眠るなんてのは初めてだったから。",
		"　どんな心境の変化か知りたくて起こしたら、有珠の方が驚いてたわ。一体、誰の仕業なんだって」",
		"　ぽん、と手を叩く草十郎。",
		"　お茶の用意はしたけれど、<後|あと><片付|かたづ>けをした記憶はまったくない。",
		"　まずいな、という顔をする草十郎と、そんな彼を見て楽しむ青子。",
		"「そうか……それじゃあ、有珠は怒っていただろう」",
		"「当然。駒鳥がとばっちりでドリブルされてたしね」",
		"「ああ、俺でも怒る。片付けをきちんとしないなんて、だらしないにもほどがある」",
		"　なんたる失態、と草十郎は激しく自分を責めた。",
		"「論点違うっ！　あのね、寝顔をまぢかで見られたから怒ってるのよ有珠は！」",
		"「え…………そうかな。有珠は、そういうのは気にしないと思うんだけど」",
		"「アンタはそうかもしれないけど、私たちは気にするの！」",
		"　ぎりり、とガラスを裂く擬音のような目で睨む青子。",
		"　私たち、という響きに言いようのない迫力を感じる草十郎だった。",
		"「それは蒼崎たち限定の話か？」",
		"「世間一般での常識よ。自分が気にしないからって他人もそうだと思ってると、いつか火傷するからね」",
		"「む。でもそれだったら、ロビーで寝ている有珠にだって問題ないか？　見かけたら放っておけないだろう、あんなの」",
		"「……その心意気は立派だけど、そこはそれ、この館の持ち主は彼女だから。",
		"　この洋館内で貴方が出会ったあらゆる<不義|ふぎ><不始末|ふしまつ>、<失敗|しっぱい><失|しっ><態|たい>の責任は草十郎に押しつけられるの。",
		"　この意味、分かる？」",
		"　あんまりな青子の言葉に、草十郎はむむ、と考えこんで、",
		"「―――つまり、ここは有珠の自治領なんだな？」",
		"「はい、よくできました。正確には私と有珠のだけどね。",
		"　領主は何をやっても許されるってコトよ」",
		"　笑顔で言って、青子はソファーに腰を下ろした。",
		"　草十郎は青子の向かいのソファーの後ろに立ったまま、今の会話を振り返っていた。",
		"　有珠の自治領、青子の自治領と言うが、そもそも彼女の家族、実家はどうなっているのか。",
		"「蒼崎。君、ご両親はどうしてるんだ？」",
		"　草十郎はつい、思いついた疑問を口にする。",
		"「生きてるわよ。三咲町から下りに四駅いった<陶川|とうかわ>ってところの地主。師は祖父だけど、今は隠居して両親と一緒の土地に住んでるわ」",
		"「……む。そう聞くと、なんだか普通の家庭だな」",
		"　魔法使いの一族というから、草十郎はもっと破天荒なものを想像していたらしい。",
		"「両親はね。父さんにはあんまり魔術回路は作られなかったみたいだから。その分、私には二世代分の潜在能力があるって祖父は言ってるけど、どうだか。",
		"　草十郎の期待してるような一族は、どっちかって言うと有珠のほうよ。私と違って英国出身だからね、彼女」",
		"　そこまで口にして、いけない、と青子は会話を止めた。",
		"　有珠の事は本人から訊く―――目の前の少年はそう言った。その方針を、こんなところで台無しにする訳にはいかない。",
		"「ま、詳しくは本人から訊きなさい。有珠の紅茶好きもそこからきてるんだし。",
		"　……そう言えば、なんで今日にかぎってリーフティーなんか淹れたの？　ティーバッグを使ったほうがまだマシだったでしょうに」",
		"「蒼崎が、そっちの方がいいって言ったじゃないか。",
		"　有珠は紅茶にうるさいって」",
		"　むう、と自らの失言に青子は言いよどむ。",
		"　大雑把に見えて細かい事を覚えているヤツめ、と。",
		"「……ま、いいわ。それより明日の放課後だけど、またひとりで帰ってくれない？",
		"　年明けの行事があるんだけど、その場しのぎで言った<餅|もち>つき大会が通っちゃってさ。明日も忙しいのよ、私」",
		"　了解、と頷く草十郎。",
		"　青子に言われずともそのつもりだったらしい。",
		"「それはいいけど、体は大丈夫か蒼崎？　昨日から寝てないだろう」",
		"「夕方に三時間ちょい仮眠をとったから調子はいいわ。",
		"　そう言うアンタこそ体は<保|も>つんでしょうね？　もう少ししたら昨日の続き、始めるわよ」",
		"　昨日の続き、とはマンツーマンによる一夜漬けだ。",
		"　あれから一睡もしていない草十郎にとって、厳しい荒行なのは言うまでもないが―――",
		"　それ以上に、嬉しくてつい頬が緩んでしまう。",
		"　転校当時、物陰からはらはらと自分の行動を監視していた彼女の、分かりづらい心遣いが思い出される。",
		"「いいよ。どのみち苦労するのは蒼崎の方だし。",
		"　異例中の異例は、有り難く受け取っておくとしよう」",
		"　晴れ晴れとした顔で返され、青子は小さく呆れながら、",
		"「……ほんと。くだらない事だけは、しつこく覚えてるんだから」",
		"　その笑顔から視線を逸らすように、やれやれと肩をすくめるのだった。",
		"　翌日。",
		"　期末試験、その最終日は滞りなく終了した。",
		"　多くの学生たちにとって十二月最大の難問は、晴れて過去の歴史と消え去った。",
		"　だが。",
		"　草十郎にとって最大の難問は、この後にこそ控えている。",
		"　明日の終業式に向けて浮き足立つクラスメイトたちと町中で別れを告げ、白犬塚の森の中へ。",
		"　昨日通りの帰宅風景、",
		"　昨日の焼き直しのような気分で、草十郎は坂道を登っていく。",
		"　草十郎とて確固たる決意に燃えている。",
		"　今日が最終期限であるし、なにより草十郎自身、あの少女の<話|こえ>を聞きたがっていた。",
		"　多少邪険に扱われても、とことん無視されても、果ては“怒らせると鏡の国に放りこまれるわよ”とニヤけ顔で笑う青子の忠告を実現させる事になったとしても、挨拶ぐらいはしたいのである。",
		"　―――しかし。",
		"　草十郎を待ち受けていたものは、半分以上、なんとなく予感していた通りの光景だった。",
		"「…………よく寝る子だな、ほんと」",
		"　目眩を覚えるほどの既視感。",
		"　見た目だけなら昨日と何ら変わらない風景に迎えられて、草十郎は素直な感想を漏らした。",
		"　少女は今日も暖炉の<傍|そば>で眠っている。",
		"　正座から横にしなだれ落ちた両足は、絵本で見る少女の座り方に似ていた。",
		"　昨日よりは<幾分|いくぶん>居心地のいい座り方だろう。",
		"　たまに奇跡的な察しの良さを発揮する彼は、それで事の<絡|から><繰|くり>が読めてしまった。",
		"『……学校で、鳶丸はひとり何をしているんだろう……』",
		"　ちらりと入ってきた玄関へ視線を投げて、よし、と気合いを入れて腕まくりをする。",
		"　何もかも昨日の通りなら、自分もそれに合わせてみようと思ったのか。",
		"　草十郎は鞄を置いて台所に向かった。",
		"　もちろん昨日と同じ、不出来な紅茶を淹れるために。",
		"　フォションは怒られたので、今日は反省してジャクソンのフルーツハーブを手に取る。",
		"　……悲しいかな、これが今の草十郎の限界だった。",
		"　お茶の葉の種類で怒られたのではなく、それを使いこなせなかった事が問題だったと気付いていない。",
		"　ポットに紅茶を淹れてロビーに戻る。",
		"　白い息をこぼして草十郎は暖炉の前にあぐらをかいた。",
		"　自分で淹れたフルーツミックスを口にし、鞄から教科書を取りだす。",
		"　期末試験は終わったけれど、一日目の科目はいくつか補習を宣言されたので、やっぱりこうなる運命なのだ。",
		"　ロビーは外より<幾分|いくぶん>暖かいが、快適にはほど遠い。何らかの暖が恋しくなる寒さだ。",
		"　冬の寒気を色濃く残すホールで、草十郎は電子工学のテキストに没頭した。",
		"　選択する生徒が少ないという理由で勧められた科目だが、高校から基礎が始まる分、他の科目より少しだけ面白い。",
		"『けど、蒼崎の言う通り』",
		"　味の分からない紅茶を空にして、カップに二杯目を注ぐ。",
		"　陶磁器のポットは保温性に勝れているので、紅茶はまだ温かい。",
		"『文字で物事を覚えるのは、苦手みたいだ』",
		"　ぼんやりと思いながら、草十郎は文字の羅列を読み進める。",
		"　ロビーに電灯はなく、天窓からの日射しだけが頼りだ。",
		"　斜に差しこむ光はロビーに明暗を作り、壁際の暖炉はじき影に沈もうとしている。",
		"　見ようによっては、灰に<浸|ひた>された廃墟の風景。",
		"　あるいは、くすんだ童話の中に忘れられた、色あせた挿し絵の世界。",
		"　白い城壁の部屋で、時間は人知れず、太陽の目を盗むようにこつこつと流れていった。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　そうして、ゆるやかに時間が過ぎたあと。",
		"　ぱたんと教科書を閉じた音が、くすんだ風景を現実に引き戻した。",
		"　草十郎は腕を伸ばして肩の凝りをほぐすと、いそいそと後片づけをはじめる。",
		"　本を鞄にしまい、",
		"　有珠のカップはそのまま床に残し、",
		"　自分の使ったカップをトレイに載せて立ち上がって、",
		"「バイトの時間だ」",
		"　あっさりと。",
		"　そういう事なら仕方ない、と納得するように口にして、眠るロビーを後にした。",
		"　―――その直前。",
		"　背後からの物音を聞いて、草十郎は足を止めた。",
		"　鞄を<脇|わき>に挟んだままトレイ片手に振り返る。",
		"　有珠用のカップに注がれた紅茶に波ひとつ立てず、",
		"「や」",
		"　気軽な口振りで、草十郎はそう語りかけた。",
		"　暖炉の横で座ったままの、黒い瞳の眠り姫に。",
		"　有珠は彫像のようだった寝顔と変わらない静かさで草十郎を見ている。",
		"　それを見て、草十郎は今更ながら有珠と青子の違いに気が付いた。",
		"　青子は、その思考経路は謎としても、実に分かりやすい意思表示をしてくれる。",
		"　トレードマークである不機嫌そうな顔は、何に不機嫌なのかはさておくとして、常に意思を反映している。",
		"　対して、有珠はそもそも感情が読めない。",
		"　怒っているのか悲しんでいるのかさえ表れない。",
		"「何の、つもり―――？」",
		"　沈みこむような問いかけ。",
		"　敵意なのか疑問なのかすら、草十郎には判別がつかない。",
		"　もし前者なら、有珠を相手にあの夜の再現になるかもしれない。",
		"　粉々に散った小瓶が草十郎の脳裏をよぎる。",
		"　返答次第では無事では済まないと承知して、",
		"　しばし迷ったあと、草十郎は覚悟を決めた。",
		"　と、言うより―――",
		"「そうだな。一口じゃ説明できないから、座るよ」",
		"　何が正しい選択か考えもつかなかったので、単純に、自分のしたい事をする事にした。",
		"「………………」",
		"　返事はない。",
		"　黒衣の少女は嫌がっているようにも見えたが、草十郎はあえて無視した。",
		"　もう一度床に座ってトレイを置くと、ふたりの視線はぴったりと合った。",
		"　底の見えない有珠の瞳は、依然として余人を寄せつけない。",
		"　が。肝心の草十郎は、そんな重圧をまったく感じてはいないようだった。",
		"「それで、なに……？」",
		"「ああ。遅くなったけど、こうして話がしたかったんだ、有珠と」",
		"　一口じゃ説明できないらしいのに、草十郎はあっさりと一口で説明した。",
		"「わたしと……？　青子とではなく？」",
		"「ん？　そうだね、蒼崎とはもっと話したいところだけど、それよりは三人で話してみたい」",
		"　草十郎の意図が読めず、戸惑う有珠。",
		"　そんな有珠の困惑に気付かず、草十郎はしかつめらしく話を続ける。",
		"「蒼崎は普段から有珠とは会話がないって言うんだ。それが俺のせいなら困るし、俺のせいじゃないならもっと困る。",
		"　せっかく同じ場所に居るのに会話がないなんて、もったいないと思うんだ」",
		"　噛みしめるような、やけに情感の籠もった声。",
		"　有珠には少年の意図はこれっぽっちも掴めない。",
		"　けれど、彼が自分に対して強く、何かを願っているのは感じ取れる。",
		"　……それが。",
		"　恐れに起因するものでない事が、彼女には意外だった。",
		"「貴方は、わたしが恐くないの……？」",
		"「ああ。だってそう言えるほど、俺は君をよく知らない」",
		"　見開いた瞳は<玻|は><璃|り>細工のように。",
		"　少女にとって、少年の予想外さはもう驚きの域だった。",
		"　あまりにも素直な、脊髄反射のような答え。",
		"　そんな無遠慮極まりない言葉が、なぜか不快と感じない。",
		"　ふたりの会話はそこで途絶えた。",
		"　いや、もとより会話は成立していない。",
		"　不思議と居心地のいい沈黙を嫌うように、少女は気を引き締める。",
		"　少年はそんな少女の視線を、怯えることなく受けとめる。",
		"「…………話」",
		"「ん？」",
		"「わたしと話をしたいと言ったでしょう。",
		"　なら、好きにしてみたら……？」",
		"　できるものならしてみろ、という少女の誘い。",
		"　草十郎には彼女に話しかける話題も、親密さもない。",
		"　意地の悪い少女の挑発は、しかし。",
		"「じゃあ、あの鳥の話を。ほら、そこにいる青い鳥。",
		"　たまに見かけるんだけど、君の飼い鳥か？",
		"　それともほら、なんて言ったかな。プロイ、だっけ。あの鳥も有珠の使い魔？」",
		"「っ―――」",
		"　一瞬、少女の瞳に人間らしい色が灯る。",
		"　あの厄介者、と睨みつけるような視線だった。",
		"「……アレもプロイだけど、わたしとは何の関係もない<駄鳥|だちょう>。ずいぶん古くから<在|い>るだけで、わたしもよく知らないわ」",
		"「？　じゃあ勝手に住んでるのか、この家に？」",
		"「勝手になんて、わたしが許す筈がないでしょう。",
		"　……ロビンは本当に役に立たないけど、あんなのでも母から譲り受けたものだから。失敗続きでも、特別に住まわせてあげてるの」",
		"「そっか、安心した。ここに住むの、役に立たなきゃダメってワケでもないんだね」",
		"「っ―――」",
		"　無防備な笑顔を向けられて、少女は顔を<逸|そ>らして黙りこんでしまった。",
		"　あとの時間は、草十郎が喋るだけの一方通行だ。",
		"　日々のアルバイトのこと。学校のこと。遊園地でのこと。町のこと。家賃のこと。",
		"　そんな益体のない話をすること二十分。",
		"　さすがにこれ以上は延ばせない、と少年は会話を切った。",
		"「ごめん。アルバイトがあるから、もう行くよ」",
		"　……この通り。",
		"　せっかくの機会をあっさり諦めるあたり、本当に何も考えていなかったらしい。",
		"　草十郎はトレイを厨房に戻し、鞄をロビーに置いて玄関に向かう。",
		"　有珠は彼のそんな淡泊さを知らなかった。",
		"　なので、意表をつかれて見届けそうになって、つい、",
		"「―――待って」",
		"　必要もないのに、その背中を呼び止めていた。",
		"「ん、なに？」",
		"「…………その。",
		"　今日は、ポットがあったけど」",
		"「あ、うん。昨日の反省点だったから。結局、使ったのは自分だけだけど」",
		"「そう。……そのポットはコーヒーとの兼用だから、ハーブティーには合わないわ」",
		"　む、と目を見張る草十郎。",
		"　言われてみれば、紅茶のポットとカップは何種類もあった。どうも各紅茶には専用のティーセットが定められているらしい。",
		"「……なかなかに奥深い。",
		"　あれかな、慣れない事はするもんじゃないってコトか」",
		"　やれやれと嘆息する。",
		"「……どうして、わたしを起こさなかったの？」",
		"　草十郎の言葉なんて聞いていないのか、それとも、それが本当に訊ねたかった事なのか。",
		"　有珠は彼の言葉を<遮|さえぎ>って問いただした。",
		"　草十郎はむ、と自問するように黙りこむ。",
		"　言われて見れば、昨日も今日も“有珠を起こす”という発想に、まったく思い至らなかったからだ。",
		"「……言って。",
		"起こす気も、起きることも期待していなかったのは、なぜ？」",
		"　その視線には殺意すら含まれている。",
		"　深い瞳にはどんな嘘も通用しない。",
		"　夕暮れのロビーは一転して、生死を分かつ法廷になっていた。",
		"　嘘も、つまらない答えも許さない。",
		"　何を口にしようと心臓を貫かれそうな雰囲気の中、草十郎が抱いた感情は恐れより痛みだった。",
		"　久遠寺有珠の声は冷たく、また、回答を拒絶している。",
		"　少年は漠然と、地面に落ちながら<独|ひと>り立ちしたひな鳥を連想した。",
		"　一縷の希望を待ちながら、その希望の<在処|ありか>を憎む、取り残されたモノの喘ぎ。",
		"「言わなきゃいけないか？」",
		"　有珠はこくりと頷く。",
		"「じゃあ言うけど、別に深い考えがあったワケじゃない。",
		"　単に、寝た子を起こすのはよくないだろ」",
		"「……冗談は聞いてないわ」",
		"「冗談じゃないよ。眠っているのならそのままでいいと思ったんだ。話はしたいけど、それはまた、目が覚めた次の機会にするべきだって」",
		"「……ずいぶんと悠長なのね。青子が貴方を守るのは今日までだって聞いているけど。",
		"　わたしに取り入る機会はこれが最後なのに。",
		"　それとも―――あれだけ忠告されておいて、まだ何も分かっていないの？」",
		"　何も分かっていない。",
		"　約束はした、事情も分かった、同じ人間として話し合えた。だから―――もう殺される事はないはずだ、と。",
		"　そんな良識、常識からの判断なら、少女はこの場で魔女としての鉄槌を振り下ろす。",
		"　くだらない勘違いは、どちらにとっても害にしかならないからだ。",
		"「そりゃ何も分からないよ。魔術とか魔法とか、たった数日で分かるもんか。",
		"　はっきりしているのは、有珠も蒼崎も言った事はきっちり守るってコトだけだ」",
		"「なら、どうして」",
		"　眠っている自分を起こして、命を<乞|こ>わなかったのかと視線で問う。",
		"　有珠は知っている。",
		"　この少年が自分を起こさず立ち去ろうとした時に見せた表情を。",
		"“そういう事なら仕方がない―――”",
		"　あの顔は、一体どういう意味だったのか。",
		"「どうしてって、そう言われても困る。",
		"　……そうだな。機会が訪れなかったのなら、それはそういう事だと思ったのかもしれない。",
		"　君の寝顔はそれぐらい、なんていうか判断に困った。蒼崎とは違う意味で、簡単には関われないと思ったんだ」",
		"　うまく言葉にできないながらも、草十郎はあの時の気持ちを口にする。",
		"　誰かを必要としているクセに誰も望んでいない、眠りの森の少女の姿を。",
		"「……そう。でも、静希君は関わろうとしているのね。",
		"　その機会は、訪れなかったのに」",
		"「機会はやってきたよ。なんで、こっちも今日ぐらいは自分の勝手にして、無茶をしたくなったんだ」",
		"「静希君の言う通りなら、わたしは貴方を拒絶するしかないのに？」",
		"「まあ、そこが難しいところなんだけど」",
		"　草十郎はちらりと玄関に視線を向ける。",
		"　今は何の意味もない行為だが、そうせずにはいられなかったのだ。",
		"「たぶん、そこを解決したがってるのは俺だけじゃないと思うよ」",
		"　自問めいた答えは少女に対して向けられたものでもある。",
		"　それが大きな間違いだという事を、有珠は分かっている。",
		"　全て彼の勘違い。",
		"　死に瀕した子猫に手を伸ばそうとする程度の、清らかで浅ましい、小さな善性。",
		"　それが、有珠には<茨|いばら>のようにいとわしかった。",
		"　……久しぶりに、胸に痛いと感じたのだ。",
		"「……けど、わたしは貴方の同居を認めてはいないわ」",
		"　そんな心を隠すように、うつむき加減に有珠は言った。",
		"　立っている草十郎からでは、今の有珠が、あの時の青子と同じ顔をしている事には気づけない。",
		"「だろうな。それはきっと、今は解決できない問題だ。",
		"　でもそのうち、何かの気まぐれであっさり終わるものかもしれない。だからその時まで、有珠はずっと、俺を嫌っていていいんだと思う」",
		"「―――――――――」",
		"　息を飲む気配は、それこそ声のように。",
		"　その時まで、嫌ってもいいと。",
		"　そんな言葉を、少女は今まで、いや、一度だけ、強く願った事があって―――",
		"「だいたいだぞ。有珠だけじゃなく、蒼崎も同居を認めてない節があるじゃないか。",
		"　だから、認めてもらう、なんて意気ごみ自体が間違いなんだ。どうあっても俺は蒼崎や君たちとは違うんだし。",
		"　となると、あとは我慢してもらうしかない。",
		"難しい話だけど、一緒にいても邪魔にならないぐらいなら、その可能性はあがらないか？」",
		"　たしかにその通りなのだけど、それが出来るのなら苦労はしない―――と、そこまで思って、有珠はなるほど、と頷いてしまった。",
		"　彼が企んだ訳ではないのだろうが。",
		"　こうして会話が成立している時点で、自分は術中に<嵌|はま>ってしまったのだ。",
		"「例えば、貴方が<隣|となり>にいても眠っていられるぐらいに？」",
		"「そうだね、例えばの話」",
		"　笑顔で返して草十郎はロビーを後にする。",
		"　その後ろ姿を有珠はもう止めなかった。",
		"　玄関から外に出た少年は、心機一転してアルバイト先に足を向ける。",
		"　ただ、その前に。",
		"「じっさい、覗き見は趣味が悪いと思う」",
		"　誰かに告げるように、そんな文句を呟いた。",
		"　草十郎が洋館を後にしてから二分ほど経った後、足音を忍ばせて、長い髪の人影がロビーに入ってきた。",
		"　今まで外から様子を<窺|うかが>っていた、蒼崎青子その人である。",
		"「……帰ってたの？」",
		"　むっとした目付きで、有珠は青子に語りかけた。",
		"　どれほど外に居たのか、青子の体は寒さで震えている。",
		"　手袋は悪、と公言している青子は、よほどの寒さでなければ手袋はつけない。それが災いして、長い指が哀れなほど赤くなっていた。",
		"「ちょっと前にね。それでどうだったの有珠？　ずいぶんと話してたみたいだけど」",
		"　吐息で両手を温めながら、青子はどこか楽しそうに問いただす。",
		"「………………」",
		"　その意地の悪い顔で、有珠は事の<絡繰|からくり>を読み取った。",
		"「……貴女がここまで過保護とは思わなかったわ。",
		"　意地？　それとも義務？」",
		"「どっちかっていうと成り行きね。",
		"　で、どうだったのよ結果は。気にくわなかったら実力行使に出るって言ってたじゃない」",
		"「………………」",
		"　上機嫌な青子を前に、有珠はますます面持ちを暗くしていく。",
		"　話は昨日の夕食までさかのぼる。",
		"　ロビーでの一件で草十郎への不信感、および関心がメーターを振り切ったのか、有珠は“明日も彼をひとりで帰して”と青子に強要した。",
		"　今日の眠りは薬による擬似的なもので、意図的に昨日の状況を再現したものである。",
		"　状況はうまくいったが結果は彼女の予想から外れ、また、お節介な同居人が壁越しに手に汗握っていた、というのも面白くない。",
		"　さらに付け足すのなら、そんなどうでもいい事に腹を立てている自分にも呆れてしまう有珠だった。",
		"　床に置かれたティーカップを見つめる有珠。",
		"　その白い指が冷えたカップの<縁|ふち>をなぞっていく。",
		"「……青子の言う通り、害にはならない人ね。",
		"　あくまで、今のところの話だけど」",
		"　青子に内心の苛立ちを見せないよう、有珠は冷淡な感想を述べた。",
		"　その時点で、もう結論は出ているようなものだが。",
		"「あら、それだけ？　有珠にしては長く話してたのに」",
		"　白状しろ、とばかりに青子はしつこく繰り返す。",
		"　有珠はそんな同居人を冷徹に見据えると、",
		"「青子。貴女、隠していたわね」",
		"　敵意すらこめて、彼女の不義を糾弾した。",
		"　ロビーの空気が凍る。",
		"　ふたりの少女は相手の出方を探るように見つめ合った。",
		"「…………流石ね。よくそこに気が付いたもんだわ。でも、こればかりは譲れないのよ」",
		"　じり、と腰を落として有珠を睨む青子。",
		"「なにも全て奪うとは言っていないわ。……そうね。貴女にも三割ぐらいは回すつもり」",
		"　戦闘態勢に入った青子に動じず、有珠は視線だけで青子を牽制する。",
		"「ふん。十が三に化けちゃあ、ちょっと黙ってらんないわね」",
		"「高望みは命取りよ、青子」",
		"　凛とした姿勢のままで有珠は動かない。",
		"　そうして無言のまま、両者は長いこと見つめ合った。",
		"　ぎり、と悔しげに歯を鳴らす青子。",
		"　このままでは外敵との対決を前にして、仲間割れという形で幕は下りかねない。",
		"　……加えて。",
		"　どう考えても、分が悪いのは自分だった。",
		"「…………けち」",
		"　青子はちっ、と舌打ちして敗北を認める。",
		"「悔しいけど有珠が六、私が四で手を打つわ」",
		"　無念げに妥協する青子と、満足げにうなずく有珠。",
		"「そうね。<家主|やぬし>はわたしだけど、彼を招いたのは青子だから。そのかわり、<家賃|やちん>の取り立ては貴女の役割ね」",
		"「……いいけど。あーあ、情けない。こんな事なら錬金術でもかじっておくんだった。そうすれば、こんな思いをしなくてもすんだのに」",
		"「そうでもないわ。彼ら、バブルが弾けて大変だって話よ」",
		"　妙に実感のこもった有珠の言葉に、青子ははいはいと空返事をする。",
		"　ふたりは草十郎を住まわせた後の、彼が支払う家賃の取り分を真剣に議論していたのだ。",
		"　魔術師にあるまじき口論である。",
		"　無理やり同居を強制しておいて家賃を取るあたり、詐欺を通り越してもはや暴力と言っていいレベル。",
		"「でも、そんな台詞が出るって事は有珠もようやく認めたってコトね」",
		"　よしよし、と満足する青子。",
		"「……認めてはいないけど、公園での夜、彼を結界で捕捉しなかった責任があるから。",
		"　彼と約束をした青子だけを責められないでしょう」",
		"「……約束、か」",
		"　遊園地の夜を思い出すように、青子は天井を見上げた。",
		"　たかだか一週間ほど前の出来事なのに、あれから随分と草十郎との縁が強くなった気がする。",
		"　それとも、初めて会ったあの時から縁は強いものだったのだろうか。",
		"　未来視ではない青子には、とうてい預かり知らぬコトではあるが。",
		"「ま、縁とか運とかはともかく。",
		"　変だけどいい奴よね、あいつ」",
		"　有珠に同意を求めるワケでもなく呟く青子。",
		"　それを有珠は不機嫌そうに眺める。",
		"　なにか、今の台詞が気に入らなかったのかも知れない。",
		"「青子、あの傷を知ってる？」",
		"「傷……？」",
		"　思わず口にでた声を、有珠は細い指で押し止めた。",
		"　感情的に出てしまった質問。",
		"　人に話す事ではないと分かっていたのに訊かずには―――知らさずにはいられなかった、自分しか知らない秘密。",
		"「？？」",
		"　有珠の問いに首を傾げる青子。",
		"「―――そう」",
		"　なぜか胸を撫でおろす。",
		"　青子に感じた突発的な反感も、それで晴れてくれたようだ。",
		"「―――<倖|しあわ>せな人」",
		"　そうして。",
		"　誰がどう倖せなのか口にせず、有珠は冷めきった紅茶を口にした。",
		"　とたん、その可憐な顔が苦々しい<貌|かお>を作る。",
		"「……まずい」",
		"　無情にも床に放置されるカップ。",
		"　少女の黒衣がおごそかに揺れる。",
		"　未熟な紅茶を一口だけ飲んだ有珠は、口直しとばかりに居間へと歩いていってしまった。",
		"　それを見送った後、ためらいながらも青子は残されたティーカップを手に取った。",
		"　よせばいいのに、有珠の酷評を受けた草十郎のお茶を飲む気になったのだ。",
		"　くいと一口に試した後、青子も静かにカップを戻す。",
		"「……だからティーバッグにしろって言ったのに、あの莫迦」",
		"　有珠と同じ、苦いような困ったような顔をして、青子はそう呟いた。"

		"  The second day of exams ended and Soujuurou was on his way back to the mansion.",
		"  The road grew steeper and the woods thicker as he made his way up the familiar slope.",
		"  People in town called it not a hill but a mountain, simply because it took over twenty minutes to climb.",
		"  This did not sit well with Soujuurou, for whom a mountain was something that could not be overcome so easily.",
		"  The road was paved, for one thing,",
		"  and the canopy overhead let in plenty of sunlight to guide the way.",
		"  None of the inclines were especially steep, and no animals lurked in the underbrush.",
		"  There was no chance of losing his way, no reason to worry about getting lost.",
		"\"...How sad. I'm still complaining.\"",
		"  Soujuurou quietly reprimanded himself for getting so wrapped up in his own little world.",
		"  In the past few weeks since moving here he had been constantly comparing the town with his former mountain home.",
		"  Normally he would not get upset over it,",
		"  but in recent days-since meeting Aoko, as it happened-he had become rather hung up on the differences.",
		"  He was none the wiser as to why, but he knew that Aoko was a force that could not be stopped.",
		"  This naturally made him want to quicken his own pace.",
		"  The mansion where they both lived was the antipathy of her lively personality.",
		"  It stood out like a sore thumb, even in a town like Misaki.",
		"  Some people said it was haunted.",
		"  There were no ghosts, per se, but it was inhabited by magicians, so their claims were closer to the truth than they could have possibly known.",
		"\"Speaking of which, I wonder. Between ghosts and magicians, which would be more surprising?\"",
		"  Lost in contemplation as he was, the boy failed to notice how his own lack of familiarity with city life played into the equation.",
		"  In any case, none of his pondering changed what needed to be done.",
		"  Tomorrow was the last day of exams.",
		"  That meant he only had a little longer until Aoko stopped taking responsibility for his safety.",
		"  If possible, today was going to be the day when the mansion's owner accepted his continued residence there.",
		"  Soujuurou slipped between the trees encircling the mansion and walked down the naturally tree-lined avenue that led him to the front door.",
		"\"...Here goes.\"",
		"  Taking a deep breath he stepped across the threshold.",
		"  The drawing room was where he expected to find Alice.",
		"  However...",
		"  He found himself face to face with a most unexpected scene.",
		"  A few steps in, he arrived at the large foyer extending from the mansion's entrance.",
		"  But one thing was clearly out of place.",
		"  The foyer of the mansion was like a hall in a medieval castle.",
		"  It was illuminated by the cold winter sun casting down through the skylight, unaided by artificial light.",
		"  The wooden tiles smelled of the outdoors.",
		"  And there was Alice, dressed all in black, huddled against a column so enormous it resembled a sharply cornered tree trunk.",
		"  The mansion was quite literally supporting her frail body.",
		"  Like a mother's lullaby, or a gently rocking cradle.",
		"  The heavy atmosphere within this old building suppressed even the slightest stir, almost as if warding away any disturbance to her slumber.",
		"  There she slept in the shadows of home.",
		"  Hidden away from outsiders, her sleeping figure was enough to mesmerize anyone who laid eyes upon her.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou instinctively looked up at the ceiling out of sheer awkwardness.",
		"  He wanted to surprise her, but not in this way.",
		"  Her slender frame lay asleep by the fireplace.",
		"  The scene was as beautiful as a painting, yet hard on his heart at the same time.",
		"  Her slumber seemed...breathless.",
		"  She was too still, with not even a hint of movement.",
		"  And yet, slumped against that frigid column under the cold winter sky, happiness appeared to be her blanket.",
		"  A passerby would not be blamed for thinking she was in that most peaceful state of eternal slumber: death.",
		"\"She must be pretty cold.\"",
		"  Soujuurou spoke to himself as he gazed idly upon her.",
		"  Bringing her a blanket or something warm did not so much as cross the boy's mind.",
		"  Instead, odd as it sounds, the first thing he thought to do was to go prepare some tea.",
		"  He made sure to be as quiet as possible as he opened the drawing room door.",
		"  On the table, waiting for him, were three pills.",
		"  They were the medicine Aoko required him to take every day when he arrived home.",
		"  Gulping down the vaguely sweet pills and continuing on to the kitchen, he selected a box of tea from among the many in the cabinet and brewed enough for two people.",
		"  Alice was still asleep when he returned to the foyer.",
		"  Careful not to make any noise, he crouched close to the ground.",
		"  He was startled by how cold the floor felt through his pants.",
		"  He thought it would be warmer here by the fireplace, but then again he recalled how Aoko had referred to it as \"a useless hole in the wall.\"",
		"  What was likely the case was that neither she nor Alice knew how to use it properly.",
		"  After taking the teacups from the tray and placing one in front of each of them, Soujuurou carefully pulled his textbook on classical literature from his satchel.",
		"\"I better get to work or Aozaki will get mad at me again.\"",
		"  He could still see her angry face from this morning.",
		"  The reason for her anger was still as much a mystery as the unusual look he saw briefly come across her face.",
		"  In any case, one thing was certain-he needed to start studying for tomorrow.",
		"  Thanks to Aoko's instruction, today's exams went well enough, but tomorrow's would be an even more formidable challenge.",
		"  After how angry she was this morning, he could not expect her to help him again tonight.",
		"\"Which means I'll probably do poorly, and then she'll get mad at me again. Not that my grades have anything to do with her in the first place.\"",
		"  He complained under his breath as he cracked open his textbook.",
		"  Apparently, he intended to spend his time in this fashion until Alice finally awoke.",
		"  The sound of the pages turning was the only audible noise in the grand hall.",
		"  There was no ticking of clocks, or rustling of leaves to disturb her sleep.",
		"  After a few hours Soujuurou quietly rose to his feet.",
		"  The light that filled the foyer was beginning to turn from white to red.",
		"\"Time to go to work.\"",
		"  He glanced again at Alice as he stretched his stiff back.",
		"  She slept in perfect stillness just as she had this entire time.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou arched his brow in speculation.",
		"  He had no idea what her normal sleeping schedule was like, so he had no idea as to whether he should wake her.",
		"\"...Never mind. Aozaki will be home soon anyway. She'll be fine.\"",
		"  As if reaching the end of a long train of thought, Soujuurou gave a quick nod of his head and took his leave of the mansion.",
		"  Today, work was a shift at the Chinese restaurant in Misaki's shopping district, The Mad Bear.",
		"  Their uniforms had been made by someone with an obvious preference for garish colors.",
		"  The orange apron was emblazoned with a cartoonish polar bear slashing a wok in two with its powerful claws.",
		"  The design resembled warning signs about wild animals seen in the mountains and stood out in Misaki for its one-of-a-kind originality.",
		"  This was the Chinese restaurant The Mad Bear.",
		"  Aside from its name and logo, the restaurant was the type of cheap, hole-in-the-wall dive that could be found anywhere.",
		"  It faced competition from the ever-increasing number of chain restaurants, though it had managed to last longer than other dining spots, having received rave reviews on a regular basis.",
		"  The Mad Bear prioritized the personal touch, focusing on its local clientèle, and thus made a point to offer home delivery.",
		"  It had earned the affectionate moniker QKS, the Quick Killer Stop.",
		"  Making these deliveries was Soujuurou's responsibility for the time being.",
		"  Places in Misaki within cycling distance fell under his domain. Anything beyond that was handled by a more experienced staff member on the legendary 50cc King Salmon motorbike, but anyway...",
		"\"You'll never guess what a buddy in Yashirogi told me...\"",
		"  When delivery workers were not out on deliveries they spent their shift busing tables or washing dishes.",
		"  The dinner rush was yet to come, and Soujuurou and his fellow delivery boys were shooting the breeze while washing dishes in the back.",
		"\"Yo, Shizuki!\"",
		"\"I'm listening, Kinomi, I'm listening.\"",
		"  The two were elbow deep in a giant sink as they enthusiastically scrubbed. At least, that was what they pretended to do while they gossiped.",
		"\"He said it's not just that Japanese place, you know, Keniya? He heard Imperial Metropolis and Messiaen here in Misaki got orders, too!",
		"  I mean, if you want that much meat just go to Shitaichi! Man! Who the heck orders raw meat and an entire salmon?",
		"  I tell ya, there's some weird shit going on at that place, for real. Maybe they have a pet alligator or something!\"",
		"\"I've definitely never heard of an order like that before. What's an 'alligator'?\"",
		"\"An alligator's an alligator, dude. You've really never seen one? I mean, I've never actually seen one in real life, either, but even I know what an alligator is.",
		"  You know what? I'll lend you my tape of 'The World's Most Terrifying Animals' episode on Africa.\"",
		"  This was a familiar pattern of conversation between the two, especially now Kinomi was used to Soujuurou's lack of general knowledge.",
		"  Their banter was interrupted by the delivery phone. The manager snapped up the receiver and quickly jotted down the order and address.",
		"  Once he hung up, everyone in the kitchen did their best to avoid making eye contact with him.",
		"  Nobody wanted to go rushing out for a delivery on such a cold day.",
		"\"Shizuki. This one's a little far away, but I want you to handle it.\"",
		"  The manager singled Soujuurou out for the task, seemingly unfazed by his staff's laziness.",
		"\"Here's the order, and it's an unusual one, so keep it to yourself, okay?\"",
		"  The manager tore the sheet with the order and address written on it from his memo pad.",
		"  Soujuurou took one look at it before a grimace quietly spread across his face.",
		"\"Uh, boss?\"",
		"\"Yeah?\"",
		"  The manager stared right back at him as if he could tell what it was he wanted to say.",
		"\"Look, I know what you're thinking. But I've been in this business a long time, and this is far from the strangest thing I've seen. It's no big deal.",
		"  Now help me get the stuff from cold storage.\"",
		"  Soujuurou stared in admiration as the manager, dressed in black, marched out of the kitchen in his all-business way.",
		"  Nowhere was free from the odd occurrence now and then.",
		"\"You're late!\"",
		"  It was after ten at night.",
		"  Soujuurou had taken a small detour on his way home from work, and now faced an outraged Aoko, as expected.",
		"  Seeing her so visibly irritated made him feel a rush of relief.",
		"  He did not know why she was angry, but he could tell it was a different type of anger than what he saw earlier that morning.",
		"\"Really? But it's only a little after ten.",
		"  Did something happen, Aozaki?\"",
		"  He set down the cardboard box he had been carrying in his arms and glanced toward the fireplace.",
		"  The sleeping girl was there no more.",
		"\"It's not 'only a little after' ten... You arrived after curfew!",
		"  You've got no clue why I'm angry, do you?\"",
		"\"?\"",
		"\"Just come with me to the drawing room.\"",
		"  She walked briskly to the other room without pausing, leaving Soujuurou standing in confusion, head tilted to one side.",
		"  He proceeded to pick his box back up and follow after her eagerly.",
		"  He removed his coat and hung it on a hanger as he entered the living room.",
		"  Apparently today was one of those days where Alice kept herself locked away in her room.",
		"  On the table were the familiar pills.",
		"\"It's partly my fault for not being more clear about this, but you need to come home on time. Your curfew exists for a reason.\"",
		"  Aoko handed him the pills and a glass of water with an expectant look on her face.",
		"\"But I already took the pills before I went out.",
		"  And I feel fine, anyway. I don't think I need any more pills today.\"",
		"\"Excuse me? You think this has anything to do with how you feel?\"",
		"\"Let's get real. These pills that you take every day when you come home... They're poison.",
		"  Slow-acting poison, mind, and they take half a day to kick in. If you don't take more pills before that happens, the older poison will kill you.",
		"  This is how much rope Alice is willing to give you.\"",
		"\"Get it? So drink up.",
		"  I'm enjoying this just about as much as you are.",
		"  And until I think of a way around this, you're going to have to deal with it.\"",
		"\"...Maybe I misheard you for a second. Did you say that these pills I've been taking this whole time are actually bad for me?\"",
		"  Soujuurou took the pills from her and gulped it down.",
		"  The fact that it was poison gave him no pause at all.",
		"  And as for his roommates' tyrannical behavior, he showed no signs of standing up to it.",
		"\"Using poison to cancel poison... You two are really taking the old-fashioned approach, huh?\"",
		"  Soujuurou's face relaxed into a smile upon finding the funny side of the situation.",
		"  Aoko was utterly dumbfounded as to how he could be happy at a time like this.",
		"\"I was running late on the way home because I dropped by my old apartment to get all my stuff. You could've tried calling me if it was such a big deal, you know.\"",
		"\"Your stuff? Wait...is that everything?\"",
		"  Soujuurou nodded emphatically as she pointed incredulously at the cardboard box in his hands.",
		"\"It's stupid to pay rent when I don't even live there, so I thought I should move everything out. But I arranged it so I can go back any time within the next three months.\"",
		"\"Rent...?",
		"  Oh, right.",
		" How could I forget? I'm sure Alice will be thrilled to hear about this.\"",
		"  A smile blossomed across her face, as they say.",
		"  It was the open, bold-faced look of a child who just came up with a mischievous plan.",
		"  Soujuurou shook with fear at the thought of what that smile might bring his way.",
		"\"You sure don't have much. That one cardboard box contains all your worldly possessions?\"",
		"\"This is a lot to me. Is Alice upstairs?\"",
		"\"She just went to her room, although she stayed at the dinner table longer than usual. I guess she got tired of waiting.\"",
		"  She gave Soujuurou a meaningful look while continuing to smile that sinister smile.",
		"\"She got tired of waiting? For what?\"",
		"\"I imagine she wanted to punish whoever decided to use the last of her Fauchon and Blue Calico.\"",
		"\"Why do I know that name...? I think 'Fauchon' is that brand of tea I used.\"",
		"\"It sure is. To be honest even I was shocked when I first walked in. I know how she falls asleep all over the mansion, but I've never seen her prepare tea first.",
		"  I woke her up to see if she was okay, and she was just as surprised as I was. We couldn't imagine who would do such a thing.\"",
		"  Soujuurou clapped his hands together as if remembering something important.",
		"  He had forgotten to clean up the tea before leaving.",
		"  The regret written from forehead to chin delighted Aoko immensely.",
		"\"I see... How mad was she?\"",
		"\"Pretty mad. Robin was all aflutter about it, too.\"",
		"\"Well I'm mad at myself, too, if that helps. I can't believe I forget to take them back to the kitchen.\"",
		"  Soujuurou harshly scolded himself for his failure.",
		"\"No dummy! She's mad at you because you sat and watched her sleep!\"",
		"\"Oh... I didn't think she would mind all that much.\"",
		"\"Well WE do mind when you watch us sleep, just so you know!\"",
		"  Aoko's glare was enough to make glass shatter.",
		"  There was an indescribable intensity in the way she said that.",
		"\"You mean it's a personal pet peeve for you and Alice?\"",
		"\"No, it's common sense! If you go around assuming that other people feel the same way as you, you're asking for trouble.\"",
		"\"Huh. But isn't it kind of her fault for falling asleep in the foyer in the first place? It would be stranger if I saw her like that and didn't want to look out for her.\"",
		"\"Look, I appreciate that's what you thought, but you just have to understand that that's how the lady of the house is.",
		"  While you live here, responsibility for any and all mistakes or bad judgment on your part will be laid at your feet and your feet alone.",
		"  Do you get what I'm trying to say here?\"",
		"  Aoko's question sent Soujuurou into a trance of deep thought until finally he uttered,",
		"\"So in other words, I'm in Alice's kingdom now?\"",
		"\"Yes, congratulations. Although technically this kingdom belongs to both me and her.",
		"  Which means what we say goes.\"",
		"  She smiled as she spoke and plopped herself down on the sofa.",
		"  Soujuurou remained standing behind the sofa opposite her as he ran over their conversation again and again in his head.",
		"  The notion of this being their kingdom made him realize he actually had no idea where the girls had come from or their families' background.",
		"\"Where are your parents, Aozaki?\"",
		"  He inadvertently blurted out, this being the question foremost on his mind.",
		"\"They're alive and well. They own a place in Toukawa, four stops from Misaki. I learned everything I know from my grandfather, who's retired now and lives with them.\"",
		"\"Huh. Sounds like a pretty normal family.\"",
		"  Soujuurou had imagined something more outrageous for a family of magicians.",
		"\"Sure, as far as my parents go. My father sucked as a mage. My grandfather says it skipped a generation so I get double the power, but I'm not so sure about that.",
		"  I think Alice has more the type of family you're imagining. She's from England, you know.\"",
		"  Aoko offered nothing more, as if to suggest that was as far as she was willing to reveal for now.",
		"  Soujuurou had insisted on talking to Alice directly rather than hearing things secondhand, so chose not to go back on his word by pushing the topic further.",
		"\"Ask her if you want to know more. Now you know why she loves English blends of tea so much.",
		"  ...Speaking of which, why did you use tea leaves today of all days? You should've stuck to the tea bags.\"",
		"\"But you said the leaves taste better.",
		"  And also that Alice is picky about her tea.\"",
		"  Aoko was momentarily at a loss for words.",
		"  He seemed so oblivious most of the time, but apparently he was attentive to some details, at least selectively.",
		"\"Just forget it. Anyway, think you can make it home by yourself tomorrow?",
		"  They accepted my proposal for a mochi-making festival in the new year, so I'll be pretty busy with that.\"",
		"  Soujuurou nodded in acceptance.",
		"  In fact he had already been planning to do so before she even asked.",
		"\"I'll be fine, but what about you? You haven't even slept since yesterday.\"",
		"\"Oh, I took a quick three-hour nap earlier. I'll be fine.",
		"  What about you for that matter? I hope you didn't forget about our session tonight.\"",
		"  She meant the all-night cramming session, of course.",
		"  Needless to say, Soujuurou was more than likely to struggle given that he, too, had not slept a wink.",
		"  All he could do was give a relieved smile.",
		"  He thought back to the days just after he transferred here, when she watched his every move from the sidelines and showed a startling amount of concern for him.",
		"\"I didn't forget. And besides, it's tougher on you than me, Aozaki.",
		"  I'm still glad to be your exception among exceptions.\"",
		"  His cheery response grated on her just a little.",
		"\"Wow. You manage to forget everything except the most irritating little details, don't you?\"",
		"  She heaved her shoulders in exasperation and dropped her head as an excuse to look away from the beaming smile on his face.",
		"  The following day...",
		"  The last day of finals had ended without a hitch.",
		"  That final December hurdle was finally a thing of the past.",
		"  For all but one student, that is.",
		"  To Soujuurou, the greatest challenge was yet to come.",
		"  He bid farewell to his classmates, all jittery with excitement for the last day of term, and headed into the Shiroinuzuka woods.",
		"  The road home was no different than yesterday,",
		"  like he was reliving yet another day striding up that hill.",
		"  Yet today, there was a fierce determination in his steps.",
		"  Today was his last chance, and he wanted nothing more than to talk to the girl.",
		"  He did not care if she was cruel to him or ignored him, nor whether Aoko was being truthful when she said that she could trap him in a mirror land or something like that. All he really cared about was having the chance to speak with her face-to-face.",
		"  But nothing is ever that simple.",
		"  To tell the truth, what he found upon finally entering the mansion was not wholly unexpected.",
		"\"...She sure sleeps a lot.\"",
		"  The déjà vu he was experiencing made him dizzy.",
		"  Faced with an exact reenactment of the previous day, he could not help but blurt out what he was thinking.",
		"  Alice was sleeping by the fireplace, just as she had done yesterday.",
		"  The way her legs draped to one side resembled those of a princess in a children's book.",
		"  She looked more comfortable than she had the day before.",
		"  Miraculously, he had a rare flash of insight that enabled him to read the situation more clearly.",
		"(...What could Tobimaru be doing at school on his own?)",
		"  Upon glancing back at the entrance, he made his decision, took a deep breath, and rolled up his sleeves.",
		"  If today was a reenactment of yesterday, then he supposed he would play along with that idea.",
		"  Soujuurou removed his shoes and headed for the kitchen.",
		"  He was off to prepare another ill-fated pot of tea.",
		"  Since she was angry about him using her precious Fauchon, this time he turned to Jacksons' Fruit & Herb brew.",
		"  ...Sadly, this was about as much as Soujuurou could manage to amend his behavior.",
		"  He had failed to realize that it was not the brand of tea that had landed him in hot water, but rather his incorrect brewing method.",
		"  After filling the pot with tea, he carried it back to the foyer.",
		"  His breath was visible in the cold air as he sat himself down by the fireplace.",
		"  Soujuurou took a sip of the fruity tea he prepared for himself and pulled his textbook from his bag.",
		"  Exams were over now, but he had been instructed to take extra classes for the subjects from day one of school. Quite inevitable.",
		"  The foyer was warmer than outside but still far from comfortable. It was enough to make anyone yearn for some source of warmth.",
		"  Soujuurou dove into his electronics textbook in the winter-chilled hall.",
		"  The class was not very popular, which is why it had been recommended to him in the first place. That fact that everyone who took it started on equal footing made it more appealing to him than other classes.",
		"(Aozaki was right...)",
		"  He downed the rest of the tea, having no appreciation for its flavor, and refilled his cup.",
		"  The tea was still warm, since the ceramic teapot had excellent heat retention.",
		"(I can't seem to remember anything that's written down.)",
		"  He vaguely recalled their conversation as his eyes advanced across the page.",
		"  The lack of lighting in the foyer was forcing him to rely on illumination from the skylight.",
		"  The light cut into the room at a diagonal angle in such a way as to divide the foyer into light and dark areas, with the fireplace in shadow.",
		"  The room resembled ancient ruins covered in ash.",
		"  Or perhaps the quiet, forgotten world of a faded fairy tale.",
		"  Time slipped on by within the white walls of this room, hidden away from the sun.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  The minutes passed slowly for some time. Until...",
		"  The sound of a textbook slamming shut brought the room back to reality.",
		"  Soujuurou stretched his stiff back and eagerly got started on clearing up.",
		"  He put his textbook back in his bag,",
		"placed his cup on the tray,",
		"leaving Alice's sitting in front of her on the floor.",
		"\"Well, time to go to work,\"",
		"  he said unceremoniously.",
		"  He spoke as if to convince himself that he had no other choice as he prepared to leave the sleepy foyer behind.",
		"  But before he could...",
		"  A sound behind him stopped him in his tracks.",
		"  He turned around with his bag under his arm and tray in his hands.",
		"So as not to cause even a ripple in her teacup, he greeted her,",
		"\"Hey,\"",
		"  in a light, easygoing manner.",
		"  She remained seated next to the fireplace like a black-eyed sleeping beauty.",
		"  Her face was as still as a statue, almost no different than it had been in slumber.",
		"  Looking at Alice now, he realized just how different she and Aoko really were.",
		"  Aoko communicated her feelings openly, even if he never could quite tell where they came from.",
		"  Her trademark expression of irritation would keep him guessing as to the reason she was angry, but to her credit her emotional state was always clear.",
		"  Alice, on the other hand, was completely unreadable.",
		"  She might be angry, or then again sad; he could not tell either way.",
		"\"What do you think you're doing?\"",
		"  Her question gave him a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach.",
		"  He could not decide whether it was animosity or perplexity that he heard in her voice.",
		"  If the former, this was likely to turn into a replay of their interaction from the other night.",
		"  An image of the shattered bottle sprang to his mind.",
		"  Soujuurou knew his response would be extremely important,",
		"  and after struggling for a few moments he finally worked up the courage to say something.",
		"  Just not the correct thing, unfortunately.",
		"\"Right, about that... It'll take awhile to explain, so let me just have a seat first.\"",
		"  He had no idea what the correct approach would be, so he simply did whatever came into his mind instead.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  She gave him no response.",
		"  Her face said that she detested his presence, but he plowed ahead regardless.",
		"  Soujuurou took a seat and set down the tray once more. Their eyes met.",
		"  Her inscrutable gaze was enough to turn most people away.",
		"  But, the target of her animosity appeared not to notice it at all.",
		"\"Yes...?\"",
		"\"Ah, well, I guess I should have done this a long time ago, but I've been wanting to talk to you about something, Alice.\"",
		"  Despite having suggested that it would take time to explain, he managed to sum things up succinctly.",
		"\"Me? Not Aoko?\"",
		"\"Hm? Well, I have lots to talk to Aozaki about. In fact, I think all three of us should sit down at some point...\"",
		"  Alice found herself out of kilter, unable to read his true intentions.",
		"  Soujuurou continued on, none the wiser to her bewilderment.",
		"\"Aozaki said you two rarely speak to each other. I'd feel bad if that's because of me, but I'd feel even worse if it isn't.",
		"  It's sad that we live together but never talk.\"",
		"  Each word he spoke was heavy with emotion.",
		"  Alice remained utterly unable to discern this boy's intentions.",
		"  All she could parse was that there was something he wanted from her.",
		"  ...But what could that be?",
		"  What she found even stranger was that he was not speaking to her from a place of fear.",
		"\"Aren't you afraid of me?\"",
		"\"No. I don't know enough about you to be scared of you, to tell the truth.\"",
		"  Her gleaming eyes looked like they were made of polished quartz.",
		"  His response had not been what she expected.",
		"  He spoke with pure honesty and unfettered truth.",
		"  Such boldness, however, did not actually upset her.",
		"  Their conversation ground to a halt,",
		"  if you could even call it a conversation in the first place.",
		"  Alice grew tense, as if displeased by the strangely comfortable moment of silence between them.",
		"  Soujuurou endured her cold stare, showing no sign of flinching.",
		"\"...Talk.\"",
		"\"Hm?\"",
		"\"You said you wanted to talk to me.",
		"  So... be my guest. Whatever topic you like.\"",
		"  It was more a challenge than an invitation.",
		"  He had neither a topic on hand, nor were they intimate enough to strike up a casual conversation.",
		"  Nonetheless, her challenge hanged in the air, waiting for a response.",
		"\"Well, what about that bird? The blue one over there.",
		"  I see it around now and then. Is it your pet?",
		"  Or is it one of those, what are they called... 'Ploys'? A magical familiar?\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Her eyes let slip for a moment a very natural response.",
		"  It was annoyance, such as that which one might feel toward a troublemaker.",
		"\"Yes, it's a Ploy, but the stupid bird isn't mine. It's lived here longer than I have, and I'm afraid I don't know much about it.\"",
		"\"You mean... it just decided to live here of its own free will?\"",
		"\"Of course not. I would never allow such a thing.",
		"  Robin's useless, but I inherited it from my mother. As such, I permit it to continue living here, despite its constant failures and shortcomings.\"",
		"\"I see. That's a relief. Here I was thinking I'm the only useless one in the house.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  She turned away in silence to avoid looking at his hapless grin.",
		"  Thus began Soujuurou's very lengthy monologue.",
		"  It started with his part-time job, then moved on to the school. Next came the amusement park and random gossip around town, and last the subject of rent.",
		"  He spent all of twenty minutes on mindless small talk.",
		"  Then he ran out of things to say and finally stopped.",
		"\"Sorry. I'm on the clock soon, so I should get going.\"",
		"  And that was that.",
		"  After finally getting his long-awaited chance to talk to her, he realized he had no exit plan in place.",
		"  So he returned the tray to the kitchen, placed his bag in the foyer, and headed for the door.",
		"  She had never seen the boy so candid.",
		"  Which was why, overcome with surprise, she found herself calling out to him.",
		"\"...Wait.\"",
		"  She had no reason to do so, and yet she called out anyway.",
		"\"Hm? Yes?\"",
		"\"...It's just...",
		"  I saw the pot you used today.\"",
		"\"Oh, right. I wasn't going to make the same mistake as yesterday. But I guess I'm the only one who drank any today, so...\"",
		"\"Well, that pot is normally used for coffee, so you shouldn't put tea leaves in it.\"",
		"  Soujuurou's eyes grew wide with shock.",
		"  Now he remembered that there had been all sorts of cups and teapots in the cupboard. Each one specially designed for a different type of tea!",
		"\"Who knew there was so much to brewing tea?",
		"  I guess a beginner like me shouldn't mess with things he doesn't understand, huh?\"",
		"  She let out a vexed sigh.",
		"\"Why didn't you wake me?\"",
		"  Either she had not heard what he said, or she had been waiting this whole time for a chance to ask him that.",
		"  In any case, her question abruptly interrupted his stream of thought.",
		"  He fell silent with introspection.",
		"  The thought of waking her had not so much as crossed his mind either that day or the previous one.",
		"\"...Tell me.",
		"You didn't wake me. Did you expect me to just keep sleeping?\"",
		"  Her eyes were filled with animosity.",
		"  Lies were useless against such an all-piercing gaze.",
		"  The setting sun transformed the foyer into a battle of life and death.",
		"  Lies or deceptive answers would not be permitted.",
		"  Amidst the palpable tension that filled the room, where any move, wrong or otherwise, was likely to get him killed, he felt pain rather than fear.",
		"  Alice's voice was icy cold, preemptively rejecting any response he was to give.",
		"  The boy vaguely imagined a newborn chick that had fallen from the nest, struggling to survive on its own.",
		"  It gasped, hanging on to a thread of hope, yet detesting where that thread hung.",
		"\"Do you really want to know?\"",
		"  Alice nodded sharply.",
		"\"Fine, but it's not especially meaningful or anything.",
		"  I just think it's rude to wake someone who's asleep.\"",
		"\"...I have no time for jokes.\"",
		"\"That is the truth. I just thought I should let you sleep. I really wanted to talk, but I decided to wait till the next time we saw each other.\"",
		"\"How sweet of you. That reminds me, Aoko's protection over you ends today, doesn't it?",
		"  That makes this your last chance to win me over.",
		"  So, have you, or have you not, learned your lesson, hmm?\"",
		"  He had not.",
		"  He swore to her, agreed to her terms, and gone as far as to sit face to face with her to get to know her. Surely, he thought, this was enough to escape death.",
		"  And she believed, as a mage, that his naive goodwill and simplemindedness were all the reasons she needed to execute him.",
		"  Trivial misunderstandings would only make things worse at this point.",
		"\"What lesson? What am I supposed to have learned? All this magic and magecraft stuff is way over my head.",
		"  All I know is I've done everything you and Aozaki have asked of me.\"",
		"\"Then why...?\"",
		"  Her gaze said what she really wanted to ask. She wanted to know why he did not beg for his life.",
		"  She knew the answer.",
		"  She saw the look on his face when he turned to leave without so much as trying to wake her.",
		"A look of resignation.",
		"  What on earth had it meant?",
		"\"What do you expect me to say?",
		"  I thought if the opportunity didn't present itself, then so be it.",
		"  When I saw you sleeping again I didn't know what to do. You're not exactly the easiest people to approach, you and Aozaki, though Aozaki is a little different...\"",
		"  Soujuurou struggled to find the right words, but said what he was feeling in the moment anyway.",
		"  He'd seen a sleeping witch of the wood who clearly needed someone's help yet sought the help of no one.",
		"\"But here you are trying to approach me anyway.",
		"  Even though the opportunity never presented itself.\"",
		"\"Oh, but it did. That's why I decided to do things my way today, even if nothing could go right to begin with.\"",
		"\"You talk as though you always expected me to reject you.\"",
		"\"Err, yeah, I guess it's hard to explain.\"",
		"  Soujuurou glanced at the entrance.",
		"  He had no reason to-he just felt an urge to do so.",
		"\"I doubt I'm the only one who'd like to see this situation solved.\"",
		"  He muttered as if speaking to himself, but it was clearly meant for her to hear.",
		"  Alice knew full well how poorly he had understood the situation.",
		"  All of this was one giant misunderstanding on his part.",
		"  His tiny gesture of goodwill, pitiful and pure, resembled that of someone reaching out to help a dying kitten.",
		"  For Alice, doing so would be akin to clutching the thorns of a rose.",
		"  She felt pain in her chest for the first time in quite a while.",
		"\"I still don't want you in the mansion.\"",
		"  She addressed the floor at her feet to avoid showing him how she truly felt.",
		"  If he had, he would have seen that her face looked just the way Aoko's had earlier.",
		"\"I'm sure you don't. And I doubt that'll change anytime soon.",
		"  But that doesn't mean we can't work something out. It's okay if you keep hating me in the meantime.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Her gasp of breath was like a response in itself.",
		"  To suggest she could keep hating him...",
		"  She had once wished to hear those words so dearly, if only the once.",
		"\"I mean, you're not the only one. That goes for Aozaki, too. I don't think she wants me here, either.",
		"  Expecting to feel welcomed would be a big mistake on my part. We're fundamentally different people, and that's never going to change.",
		"  I just want you to tolerate me.",
		"I know it's a lot to ask, but is there a way I could live here without bothering you too much?\"",
		"  Thinking that of course it was possible, but if it were that easy none of this would have been necessary in the first place, Alice nodded in agreement.",
		"  There was no way he could have planned for things to work out this well.",
		"  But his plan in fact had worked, if inadvertently, from the moment the conversation began.",
		"\"You mean, so that I can sleep undisturbed even with you sitting right next to me?\"",
		"\"Sure, why not.\"",
		"  Beaming, Soujuurou stood up and left the foyer.",
		"  Alice did not stop him this time.",
		"  He had a newfound spring in his step as he headed to work.",
		"  But something gave him a moment's pause.",
		"\"It's not nice to spy on people.\"",
		"  He complained aloud to make sure a certain someone heard him.",
		"  No more than two minutes had passed since Soujuurou left the mansion when a long-haired figure came creeping into the foyer.",
		"  Aoko Aozaki had been just outside the entire time, eavesdropping.",
		"\"...When did you get home?\"",
		"  With a sullen glare, Alice addressed the interloper.",
		"  Aoko was shivering from head to toe after standing in the cold for so long.",
		"  She deemed gloves an abomination and refused to wear them except in the most extreme cold. As a result, her slender fingers were pitifully swollen and red.",
		"\"Don't know, a while ago. Anyway, how did it go? You two were talking for so long...\"",
		"  She looked strangely elated, as she blew on her hands to warm them.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Alice was not fooled at all by Aoko's facade, clear from the ill-tempered look she wore on her face.",
		"\"...I never expected you to be so overprotective.",
		"  But did you do it out of stubbornness, or obligation?\"",
		"\"Oh, please, I was just going with the flow.",
		"  But seriously, how did it go? You told me you'd resort to force if he made you mad.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Alice's mood was growing darker and darker the longer she had to look at Aoko's cheerful posturing.",
		"  It all went back to their dinner together the previous night.",
		"  After everything that happened in the foyer, Alice was both more suspicious of and intrigued by Soujuurou than ever before. She insisted that Aoko let him walk home alone the next day.",
		"  She then used a concoction to fake her slumber and recreate the same scene as the previous day.",
		"  That portion of her plan went well, but the rest had veered totally off course. It did not help to know her roommate had savored every moment of it from the other side of the wall, either.",
		"  To make matters worse, Alice was frustrated at herself for letting such trivial matters bother her.",
		"  She  stared at the teacup still sitting on the floor.",
		"  Her pale finger traced its cold rim.",
		"\"It's as you said. He is harmless.",
		"  ...For the time being.\"",
		"  She forced a tone of indifference in order to hide her irritation with her apprentice.",
		"  It was in this moment that Soujuurou's fate was decided.",
		"\"That's it? You were talking for what seemed like forever.\"",
		"  Relentless, Aoko continued her line of questioning.",
		"  Alice only stared back icily.",
		"\"Aoko, I know you were eavesdropping.\"",
		"  She voiced her displeasure at Aoko's behavior in no uncertain terms.",
		"  Suddenly the air in the foyer felt cold as ice.",
		"  They stared at one another, each trying to guess the other's next move.",
		"\"...So you did notice. This... doesn't change anything about our deal. I hope that's clear.\"",
		"  Aoko widened her stance and glared at Alice.",
		"\"I'm a reasonable person, Aoko. It's fine with me if you take thirty percent.\"",
		"  Completely unperturbed by Aoko's warlike posturing, a simple look was all Alice needed to keep her roommate in check.",
		"\"Down from all of it? Hah! Not a chance.\"",
		"\"Fly too high and you may lose those wings, Aoko.\"",
		"  Alice remained calm and dignified, not moving a muscle.",
		"  It felt like hours passed as the two stared at each other in silence.",
		"  Aoko was grinding her teeth in frustration.",
		"  At this rate, their alliance would be in tatters before they even confronted their foe.",
		"  And worst of all,",
		"  she knew Alice had the upper hand.",
		"\"...Cheapskate.\"",
		"  Aoko accepted her defeat with a \"tsk.\"",
		"\"Fine. You get sixty, I get forty.\"",
		"  It pained her to settle for less. Alice nodded in satisfaction.",
		"\"Very well. But I'm the head of the house, and you're the one who brought him here, so it's your job to collect rent.\"",
		"\"Fine. Ugh, this sucks. I should've gone into alchemy instead, then all my problems would be solved.\"",
		"\"Not really. Not even alchemists are immune to market downturns.\"",
		"  Alice spoke with the confidence of someone with first-hand experience of such matters, yet Aoko only nodded absentmindedly in response.",
		"  Their bitter fight was over how to split the take of Soujuurou's rent now that he was officially going to move in.",
		"  Not the most becoming quarrel for a pair of mages.",
		"  Forcing a boy to live with them and then demanding he pay rent was beyond extortion-it was truly vicious.",
		"\"Since we're even discussing this, I assume that means you've accepted his presence in the mansion?\"",
		"  Aoko was triumphantly satisfied with herself.",
		"\"The only thing I've accepted is my responsibility for not catching him with the Bounded Field in the park that night.",
		"  I mean, it's not as if I can blame it all on you and your promise to him.\"",
		"\"...Oh, *that* promise.\"",
		"  Aoko looked up at the ceiling as she recalled the night at the amusement park.",
		"  Only a week at most had passed since then, but Aoko already felt that Soujuurou's fate and her own had become intrinsically linked.",
		"  Or perhaps they had always been connected by fate since the moment they'd met.",
		"  She could not see into the future, so there was no way to know for sure.",
		"\"Destiny and fate aside,",
		"  he's not a bad egg. Besides being weird, I mean.\"",
		"  A thought uttered to herself in self-confirmation more than to Alice.",
		"  Alice could only look on in annoyance.",
		"  Perhaps in an attempt to voice her displeasure at her comment.",
		"\"Do you know about his injury, Aoko?\"",
		"\"Injury? What injury?\"",
		"  Alice raised her slender fingers to her mouth as if to push the words back in.",
		"  She had blurted it out in the heat of the moment.",
		"  A secret that no one else was supposed to know, but that which one couldn't keep to herself.",
		"\"?\"",
		"  Aoko tilted her head in confusion.",
		"\"...I see.\"",
		"  Alice looked relieved for some reason.",
		"  Her sudden antipathy towards Aoko had dissipated as well.",
		"\"Ignorance is bliss, I suppose.\"",
		"  Said Alice, as she took a sip of her cold tea.",
		"  She made no attempt to explain who was fortunate, or why.",
		"  A moment later, her beautiful face contorted in revulsion.",
		"\"...Yuck.\"",
		"  She abandoned the cup to the floor once more.",
		"  Her black dress unceremoniously scrunched up as she stood.",
		"  Just one sip of the under-brewed tea sent her fleeing to the drawing room to remove the bad taste from her mouth.",
		"  As soon as she was gone Aoko hesitatingly took the teacup in her own hands.",
