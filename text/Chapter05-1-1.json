		"　雲のかかった夜空の下、草十郎はあいかわらずの徒歩でアパートに帰ってきた。",
		"　カンカンカン、と<錆|さ>びた金属音を踏みながら階段を上っていく。",
		"　アパートの塀に置かれた自転車をチラリと見て、",
		"　自分も自転車があれば楽なのだろうか、でも余分な出費だし、あれば便利だけど無くて死ぬようなものじゃなし、もう少し我慢しよう、などと真剣に悩んでみる。",
		"　ドアに到着して、リンゴのつまった紙袋を抱えたまま鍵を取り出す。",
		"　　　　　“あれば便利だけど無くて―――”",
		"　ん？と首をかしげる。",
		"　<益体|やくたい>も無い自分の言葉にひっかかるものを感じた草十郎だったが、もらい物の<果物|リンゴ>をどうさばくかでいっぱいだったコトもあり、あっけなくスルーした。",
		"　紙袋を流し場に置いて、部屋の電気をつける。",
		"　時刻は午後十時過ぎ。",
		"　試験前なのでいつもより一時間早い帰宅。",
		"　とりあえずリンゴをひとつ食べてみるか、と台所を振り返ると、新聞受けに差しこまれた封筒に気が付いた。",
		"　差出人の明記はなく、切手すら貼っていない。",
		"　中には一枚の手紙が入っていて、用件と差出人の名前だけが書かれていた。",
		"　内容はいたってシンプルで、",
		"『話があるので今夜どこそこのここに来られたし、",
		"　大事な用なので来るまでずっと待っている、",
		"　言うまでもなく他言無用―――』",
		"　という<旨|むね>が、簡潔、かつ凛々しい文字で<綴|つづ>られていた。",
		"　差出人の名前は蒼崎青子とある。",
		"　丁寧な事に、待ちあわせ場所の詳細な地図まで同封されていた。",
		"　ふむ、と少しだけ首をかしげて、彼はアパートを後にした。",
		"　……その後。",
		"　主人のいなくなった部屋で残された封筒はひとりでに燃えだし、はじめから何も無かったかのように、跡形もなく消滅した。",
		"　高度成長期もひとまずの落ち着きを見せ、安定期に入った８０年代後半。",
		"　街の近代化は着々と進み、新時代を代表するＪＲの駅が落成しようとしていた頃。",
		"　三咲町の隣町である<社木|やしろぎ>に、またひとつ、町の新しいシンボルが生まれようとしていた。",
		"　その名はやしろぎブレッド＆キッツィーランド。",
		"　三咲市最大の不良債権。",
		"　<後|のち>にバブルのあだ花と言われる、一つの時代の残骸である。",
		"“この町には<夢|ゆめ>とか<洒脱|しゃだつ>さが足りない”",
		"　今をさかのぼること十年前。",
		"　社木の名士であり、全国に多くの工場をかまえる<土桔|ときつ>製パン株式会社―――通称トッパンの経営者・<土桔|トキツ><由里彦|ユリヒコ>翁（当時五十六歳）はそんな使命感を合い言葉に、所有地であった社木郊外の土地を開放、三咲市を代表するレジャーランドの建築に着手した。",
		"　こうして運命の１９８１年。",
		"　完成までに三年の月日を費やし、夢とユーモアあふれる地域密着型遊園地・やしろぎブレッド＆キッツィーランドはその短い人生をスタートさせた。",
		"　敷地面積三十五万㎡。",
		"　<入り口|ゲート>をくぐった人々の目を奪う豪華絢爛なメリーゴーラウンド。",
		"　のたうつ龍のように遊園地をぐるりと囲むコースター。",
		"　当時の建築技術の限界に挑んだといわれる、無駄にギミック満載な観覧車。",
		"“完璧だ。遊園地に必要なものはすべてつぎこんだ”",
		"　自らの仕事っぷりに目を細める由里彦翁。",
		"　その自信を裏付けるように、開園当時の盛況はこの世の春だったという。",
		"　だが。",
		"　だがしかし。",
		"　夢と洒脱のバランスを、彼らは豪快に間違えていた。",
		"　あまりにも不細工、かつパチもん臭いオリジナルマスコット・キッツィーちゃん。",
		"　必要以上に園内をにぎわす焼きたてブレッドの売店。",
		"　８０年初頭から流行しだした大迷路を極限まで難解にしたミラーメイズ。",
		"“キッツィーランドにドリームはない。",
		"　ただ悪夢のようなユーモアがあるだけだ”",
		"　各種専門誌はこぞってキッツィーランドの欠点をあげつらい、客足は減少。",
		"　また、不運な事に母親とはぐれた六歳児が園内の施設で遭難し、衰弱死寸前で救出される事件まで起きてしまった。",
		"　開園から五年後の１９８６年。",
		"　悪化の一途をたどる経営不振、",
		"　キッツィーちゃんのブレイクに余生をかけていた由里彦翁の引退が重なり、キッツィーランドの運営は困難となった。",
		"　こうして、地域の人々に惜しまれながらも三咲市唯一の遊園地は、その短い一生を終えたのだった。",
		"　……また。",
		"　余談ではあるが、キッツィーちゃんをデザインしたパリ在住（自称）のアーティスト、トッキー・ユーリッヒ氏も、閉園を<悼|いた>むようにその筆を折ったという。",
		"　そして現在。",
		"　深夜零時のキッツィーランドは、かつての栄華など微塵も見られない。",
		"　オモチャ箱の片隅においやられた人形のように、ひとり寂しく、今も生き続ける町からの明かりに照らされている。",
		"「なるほど」",
		"　草十郎はぱたん、と来る途中で拾った『社木案内のしおり』を閉じた。",
		"　いまいち実感の湧かない歴史だが、これも<必衰|ひっすい>というヤツだろう、と納得する。",
		"　遊園地の正門は施錠されていなかった。",
		"　以前アルバイトにきた時、<鉄柵|いりぐち>は錆びた鎖によって施錠されていたが、今は外され、鉄柵も少しだけ開いている。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　草十郎は手紙に描かれた地図にしたがって、ひょこっと園内に侵入する。",
		"「……急ぎの用なんだろうけど。こんな夜中に、なんなんだいったい」",
		"　らしくなく<愚|ぐ><痴|ち>を言う。",
		"　世間知らずな彼にでも、この行為がよくない事だと分かっているからだろう。",
		"　廃墟になったとはいえ、立ち入り禁止の遊園地に忍びこんでいる。",
		"　不法侵入、窃盗、泥棒。",
		"決して胸を張れる事ではなく、犯罪と言えば犯罪なのだが―――",
		"「……すまない、お金は払えないんだ。",
		"　タダで入って申しわけない」",
		"　彼にとって後ろめたいのはその一点だけらしい。",
		"　目のペンキがいい感じで<融解|とけだ>しているキッツィーちゃん像に、ぱんぱん、と手を合わせる。",
		"　赤ペンキを<眼窩|がんか>から流すマスコットを通過して、草十郎は夜の遊園地へと歩き出した。",
		"　色落ちた建物。",
		"　錆び付いた機械の群。",
		"　もう時を刻むことのない、作り物の住人たち。",
		"　かつての栄華とのあまりの落差に、幽霊すらいたたまれず住み着かなくなったゴーストタウン。",
		"　―――まるで<童話|ユメ>の化石だ。",
		"　ここは<現実|人の手>によって造られながら、<現実|ひとびと>に置き去りにされた楽園の跡。",
		"　経済が安定し、",
		"　人々の生活水準は右肩あがりで、誰もが未来に不安を抱かなかった、狂騒の時代の遺物である。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　白い息を吐きながら、草十郎は廃遊園地を歩いていく。",
		"　人気はないが、山中の闇に比べればそう怖くもない。",
		"　郊外といっても様々で、キッツィーランドは遊園地にしては珍しく、住宅地の<傍|そば>に造られている。",
		"　遊園地は林に囲まれているが、それも所詮は人工のもの。教室の窓を閉ざすカーテンとなんら変わりはない。",
		"　キッツィーランドを囲む鉄柵を越え、二十メートルほど造林された木々を抜ければ、簡単に見慣れた町並みに帰ることができる。",
		"　都会の人間にとって夜の遊園地は恐怖を喚起させるものだが、草十郎にとっては、この遊園地も駅前の喧噪も“怖さ”の深度は同じだった。"

		"  Soujuurou returned to his apartment on foot as per routine, under a blanket of clouds in the night sky.",
		"  The rusty stairs of his apartment building clanged with each step.",
		"  Out of the corner of his eye, he could see the bicycles parked by the apartment building's outer wall.",
		"  He debated the pros and cons of a bicycle―how much easier life would be versus the expense, the convenience versus the necessity―but in the end, decided one was not right for him just now.",
		"  Clutching the bag of apples under his arm, he took out the key to his residence.",
		"          \"A bike sure would be convenient, but it's not like...\"",
		"  He tilted his head in confusion.",
		"  More and more he found himself preoccupied with such random thoughts, when the real issue at hand was deciding what to do with the apples he had received.",
		"  He placed the paper bag by the sink and switched on the lights.",
		"  It was just after ten in the evening.",
		"  With the end-of-term exams just around the corner, he had come home an hour earlier than usual.",
		"  As he made back for the kitchen to pick one of the apples to snack on, he found an envelope stuffed in his mail slot.",
		"  The envelope had no name, return address, or stamp.",
		"  Inside was a single piece of paper that had only the sender's name and a short message.",
		"  It read:",
		"\"There is something we need to talk about tonight.",
		"  It's important, so I'll be waiting.",
		"  Needless to say, keep this a secret.\"",
		"  A concise set of orders, neatly written.",
		"  It was signed Aoko Aozaki.",
		"  She had been considerate enough to enclose a detailed map of the meeting place.",
		"  Puzzled, he cocked his head to the side then headed out the door.",
		"  Afterward...",
		"  Upon the room's sole tenant leaving the premises, the envelope burst into flames and evaporated without a trace, as though it had never existed in the first place.",
		"  By the late '80s, Japan's postwar economic boom had somewhat stabilized and the city experienced a period of steady growth.",
		"  The city's modernization marched on, and the Japan Railways train station, a symbol of the new era, neared completion.",
		"  In Misaki's neighboring town of Yashirogi, a new symbol of its own was about to be born.",
		"  Yashirogi Bread & Kitsy Land.",
		"  It was Misaki's worst investment.",
		"  Years later it would be dubbed the fool's gold of the economic bubble, a relic of a bygone age.",
		"\"This city lacks aspiration and sophistication.\"",
		"  Ten years ago...",
		"  Yashirogi's renowned Tokitsu Baking Company ran factories all across the nation. Its proprietor was a middle-aged gentleman (then age fifty-six) by the name of Yurihiko Tokitsu, known affectionately by most as Toppan. He took it upon himself to begin development on an estate on the outskirts of Yashirogi and broke ground on a recreational wonderland that he hoped to be the pride of Misaki City.",
		"  The long-awaited opening came in 1981.",
		"  After three years of investment, this local amusement park, full of all kinds of hopes and dreams, began its short-lived tenure.",
		"  It covered more than eighty-five square acres.",
		"  Its magnificent merry-go-round dazzled all who passed through the park's gates.",
		"  Its roller coaster twisted and turned about the edges of the park like a writhing Japanese dragon.",
		"  Its Ferris wheel, packed beyond necessity with gimmicks, was said to have tested the limits of modern engineering.",
		"\"It's perfect, infused with everything an amusement park could ever need.\"",
		"  Old Yurihiko looked upon his creation and smiled.",
		"  Only boosting his confidence was the fact that its grand opening was staged during a period of prosperity, the springtime of the world.",
		"  But...",
		"  In spite of this.",
		"  They splendidly miscalculated the balance between aspirations and sophistication.",
		"  Its mascot, Kitsy, was poorly designed and appeared like a cheap knockoff.",
		"  The park was stuffed to the brim with bread stands.",
		"  Even its impossible-to-navigate mirror maze seemed out of date from the start.",
		"\"There are no dreams to be had at Kitsy Land.",
		"  Only nightmarish satire.\"",
		"  Numerous trade magazines lambasted Kitsy Land's shortcomings, and customer attendance declined.",
		"  There was even an incident where a six-year-old strayed from his mother, had an accident, and nearly died.",
		"  1986, five years after the park opened.",
		"  The situation had grown from bad to worse, and the park was hemorrhaging money.",
		"  On top of everything, Yurihiko, who had bet everything on the success of mascot Kitsy, retired, and Kitsy Land's operations were officially in trouble.",
		"  And thus, amidst the scorn of nearly all residents of the area, ended Misaki City's one and only amusement park.",
		"  What's more...",
		"  Perhaps best described as a footnote to this debacle, the (self-proclaimed) Parisian artist who designed the mascot, Toki Julich, was said to have snapped his brush in mourning over the closure of the park.",
		"  Returning to the present...",
		"  It was midnight, and the Kitsy Land of today was a shadow of its former glory.",
		"  Like a doll abandoned in the corner of a toy box, the lonely park was illuminated only by the light of the town that continued to live around it.",
		"\"So that's what happened.\"",
		"  Soujuurou closed the Yashirogi guidebook that he had picked up on the way here.",
		"  The story of its history was almost difficult to believe, but he supposed this was what people referred to as entropy.",
		"  The park's front gate was unlocked.",
		"  When he worked here the previous time, the iron fence was locked shut with a rusty chain, but the chain was nowhere to be seen and the gate left ajar.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Following the map drawn in the letter, Soujuurou quickly made his way inside.",
		"\"...It sounded urgent, but to meet this late at night? What in the world could she want?\"",
		"  Soujuurou complained, quite out of character for him.",
		"  It was probably because, in spite of his naivety, even he knew that something was amiss.",
		"  Though the park was abandoned, this was still trespassing.",
		"  Unlawful entry, larceny, burglary...",
		"These were certainly not things, or perhaps crimes, that Soujuurou was proud to do, but...",
		"\"...Sorry, I can't pay you any money.",
		"  I'm really sorry for coming in for free.\"",
		"  Money―the real reason his conscience was gnawing at him.",
		"  He clapped his hands in apology toward the statue of Kitsy, on whose eyes the paint had begun to aptly dissolve.",
		"  Soujuurou passed the mascot bleeding red paint from its eye sockets and began to walk the night park.",
		"  The buildings' colors had faded.",
		"  The collection of machines was rusted.",
		"  The man-made residents no longer felt the passage of time.",
		"  Even the ghosts themselves could not endure the disparity between this forsaken place and its previous grand stature.",
		"  It was like a fossilized dream.",
		"  These were the ruins of a paradise both created and abandoned by man and reality.",
		"  The economy had stabilized,",
		"  and the standard of living was on the rise. Nobody was overly concerned with the future. These were the remains of a wild and exciting era.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  His breath turning to white wisps before him, Soujuurou continued through the abandoned amusement park.",
		"  Though void of human presence, this was not nearly as frightening as the darkness deep in the mountains.",
		"  City suburbs can take many different forms, but Kitsy Land was unusual for an amusement park insomuch as it had been built adjacent to a residential district.",
		"  The park was surrounded by a forest, but even that, ultimately, was man-made. It was no different from the curtains on a classroom window.",
		"  If he were to scale the iron fence encircling Kitsy Land and break through the twenty meters of afforested trees, he could make it back to the familiar townscape.",
		"  Though the amusement park tended to arouse dread in the city folk, to Soujuurou it was little different from the commotion and terror of downtown."
