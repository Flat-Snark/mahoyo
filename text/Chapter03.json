		"　つまり、",
		"昨日こんな事があった。",
		"　“月の無い夜は、決して振り向いてはいけないよ―――”",
		"　それは教訓だったのか、警告だったのか。",
		"　ずいぶんと昔……私がまだ今の<自分|ありかた>を夢にも思っていなかった頃。",
		"　突然、何の前触れもなく、泣きだしたくなるぐらいの不安でいっぱいになって、祖父の工房に逃げこんだ夜の話だ。",
		"　祖父は別人のように優しく微笑み、私の頭に静かに手を乗せて、",
		"　“―――<赤色|あかいろ>の死が、おまえの背中を見ているからね”",
		"　そんな、気休めどころかより絶望的な言葉を残して、私を家につき返した。",
		"　私はあの夜、たしかに背後に<潜|ひそ>む影を認めた。",
		"　ずっと遠くから私を見ている何者か。",
		"　それは少しずつ、年々距離を<縮|ちぢ>めていき―――",
		"　小さな点ほどだった気配は、その息づかいさえ感じるほどすぐ後ろまで迫っていた。",
		"　もちろん錯覚。",
		"　振り向いた先には誰もいない。",
		"　ただ―――きっかけになったあの夜。",
		"　あの時の言いようのない不安は、間違いなく、約束された<恐怖|し>に起因するものだった。",
		"“",
		"……Hey diddle diddle,The cat and the fiddle,",
		"　The cow jump'd over the moon,",
		"　The little dog laugh'd……”",
		"　……あれはいつの話だっただろう。",
		"　遠い子供の頃の記憶の片隅。",
		"　絵日記じみたかすかな思い出。",
		"　……暗い夜には決まって祖父の言葉が耳に響く。",
		"　どんなに風が強く吹いても、<傍|かたわ>らの少女の<鐘|うた>が聞き惚れるほどのものでも、不吉な言葉をかき消す事はできない。",
		"「……ご到着ね」",
		"　傍らの<少女|ありす>が言った。",
		"　抑揚のない声は、完全に傍観者でいる事を示している。",
		"　夜の公園には私と彼女だけ。",
		"　今日は私にとって“今の自分”の誕生日。",
		"　記念すべき<初陣|ういじん>にしては、少々不吉な夜と言わざるをえない。",
		"　ぶあつい雲は黒い傘のように星明かりを<遮|さえぎ>っている。",
		"　強い風は夜空を引き裂き、重い雲を運んでいく。",
		"　公園の真ん中に立つ柱時計の針は、二本とも頭上の月を指すように頂点を向いている。",
		"　あいにくと、今日は月のない夜だったけれど。",
		"　冬の大気は、深夜になって狂暴さを増している。",
		"　息を吸うだけで体の中が凍る気がする。",
		"　骨に染みこむような冷気は、そのまま背骨を通じて脳に直接入りこんでくる。",
		"　思考が寒さで麻痺しないよう、",
		"　指先が寒気で化石にならないよう、",
		"　私は、自分の<鼓動|リズム>と感情を炎にくべた。",
		"「触覚を<譲|ゆず>るわ。……幸運ね。",
		"　あの位置なら刻んでおいた<鬼火|ウィスプ>が灯る」",
		"　有珠の言葉に頷きだけで応える。",
		"　その時、一瞬だけ地面が見えた。",
		"　……私の両足はかすかに震えている。",
		"　寒いから震えているんだ、と判断したけれど自信はなかった。",
		"　本当は寒さではなく恐怖で<痺|しび>れてしまっているのかも知れない。……ホッと息を吐く。感情が働いているのなら、私はじゅうぶんに人間らしい。",
		"　そんな感傷にひたる間もなく、結界の感触が有珠から私に移ってきた。",
		"　この公園一帯に敷かれた透明の<境|かべ>。",
		"　地中深くまで根を張った認知外の絨毯。",
		"　―――夜に<浸|ひび>く、久遠寺有珠の<童話詠唱|マザーグース>。",
		"　それらの感覚と、私の体がひとつになる。",
		"　ざわり、と右腕に鳥肌がたつ。",
		"　誰かが私の腕に侵入したのだ。",
		"　鳥肌は<蟻|あり>のように右腕を<這|は>い上がってくる。",
		"　ゆっくりと、確実に、この心臓めがけて。",
		"　払い<除|の>けたくなる衝動をおさえて、より決定的な位置、より確実な到来を待つ。",
		"　月の無い夜。",
		"　公園の小さな街灯だけでは、闇の<全容|すべて>は見渡せない。",
		"　蟻の進行は止まった。",
		"　私の右腕から離れて離れて<心臓|まなか>のとなり。",
		"　視覚を動員することなく、闇に<潜|ひそ>む侵入者の姿が見える。",
		"　ここから<右舷|うげん>後方三十歩ほどの茂みの<陰|かげ>、四つんばいに手足をついたソレは<手招|てまね>きするように右手をあげ―――",
		"「―――そこ！」",
		"　私の知覚と、敵の行動はほぼ同時だった。",
		"　体が振り向く。",
		"　敵の腕は槍のように伸びた。",
		"　高速で後頭部に放たれた凶器が、私の髪をさらっていく。",
		"　有珠から結界を<譲渡|じょうと>され、ここ一帯そのものとなった全能の知覚が、最小の回避を可能とする。",
		"　礼儀知らずの蛮行に舞い上がる髪。",
		"　頬をかする、小さいが鋭い痛み。",
		"　―――死が、魂に触れた気がした。",
		"「っ―――！」",
		"　体内の血流を、異なる<循環|かいろ>に切り替える。",
		"　秒速一メートルで体内を巡る血液が、架空の元素に変質する。",
		"心臓はまったく別の<生|エ><成|ン><機|ジ><関|ン>に成りはてて、私の体を一つの回路として利用する。",
		"　熱量として計測されない不可知の運動。",
		"　私を今の私にならしめた、いまだ人の手の及ばぬ神秘。",
		"　あらゆる奇跡、<寓話|ぐうわ>の動力となる生命の火。",
		"　これを、私たちは魔力と呼ぶ。",
		"「―――<接続|セット>」",
		"　振り向いて敵を視界に収め、片手を振りかぶる。",
		"　腕は意志の代行だ。",
		"　私はまだ未熟だから、<発|こ><音|え>と<手足|どうさ>を使わないと魔術は働いてくれない。",
		"　魔術式は予め公園に刻まれている。",
		"　私がするコトは、その式に火をくべるだけ。",
		"　体内で生成した魔力を、各自それぞれの方式で流しこめばいい。",
		"　たいていの魔術師は転移方式だ。有線にしろ無線にしろ、式に魔力を<注|そそ>げばいい。",
		"　“出す”“撃つ”“流す”と色々あるけど、私の場合はなんていうか、こう―――",
		"自分の手足で<弾|はじ>く感じ……！",
		"「―――燃えろ！」",
		"　高速に高速で対抗する。",
		"　数メートル伸ばした腕はそのまま、敵は炎に包まれた。",
		"　夜の公園というコトもあってキャンプファイヤーを連想させる。ただ、炎の中で影絵のように<蠢|うごめ>くのは人間らしき姿だったけど。",
		"　不自然に発した炎は、やっぱり不自然に消えた。",
		"　物を焼く音も、焦げた臭いもあまりない。",
		"「―――結界、返すわ。死体を確認するから」",
		"　傍らの彼女に言って、もう動かない人影に足を向けた。",
		"　殺した。",
		"殺した。",
		"殺した。",
		"　相手が何者であれ、人の命に、手をかけた。",
		"　その、現実味もなければ手応えもなかった事実を、<渇|かわ>ききった喉で嚥下する。",
		"硬くて苦くてこれっぽっちも飲み込めないけど、嚥下しようと努めていた。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　私はいたって冷静だ。心拍数はレートを幾分オーバーしていて、呼吸も<千|ち><々|ぢ>に乱れているけど、頭はすっごく冷静の筈。",
		"　気が付けば消し炭はもう目の前。",
		"　反撃を想定しつつ、ゆっくり死骸を確認する。",
		"　……よし、問題なし。公園の地面に倒れ臥したそれは、燃えつきて灰になっていた。",
		"「………？」",
		"　けれど何かおかしい。",
		"　一見した感想、残骸のあり方に生命の匂いがしない。",
		"　まさか、と人影の顔を見る。",
		"　そこには目も鼻もなく、マネキンのような白い面だけがあった。",
		"「ちくしょー、またやられた！」",
		"　叫んでマネキンを蹴っとばす。",
		"　灰は風に舞い、死体も風化していく。",
		"いや、死体というのは正しくないか。これはただの人形で、結局、おびき寄せたつもりが、またハズレを引かされた。",
		"　……本当の意味での初陣は、また先送りになったということだ。",
		"「はあ……",
		"いつになったら一人前にって……",
		"あれ？」",
		"　その時、ふと視界を見慣れた物がかすめた。",
		"　むこうの滑り台の影のカタチがおかしい。なんというか、余分なモノでぷくっと太っている気がする。",
		"　戦闘の余熱でのぼせていたのか。",
		"　私は、その“余分な影”が何であるか、思い出すのに一秒もかかってしまった。",
		"「―――誰ッ！？」",
		"　自分で言うのもなんだけど、失敗だった。",
		"　その見慣れた高校の制服を着た誰かは私の声でビクっと後じさって、そのまま、",
		"ものすごい勢いで走り出した。",
		"　まるで必死に逃げるみたい―――",
		"　―――って、実際逃げてるんだアレ！",
		"「追いかけて！　見られた！」",
		"　急いで相棒に言うけれど、彼女は第三者の存在に気付いてもいなかった。",
		"　かといって自分も動けない。情けない事に、今の戦闘でまだ足がすくんでやがる……！",
		"「だめ、逃げられる！",
		"　捕まえて始末しないと……！」",
		"　上品に振る舞う余裕なんてない。",
		"　この現場を誰かに見られる事は、私たちにとって生死に関わる問題なんだから―――！",
		"「待て、この……！」",
		"　足の<痺|しび>れを振り払って公園の外に出る。",
		"　……なんて見事な逃げ足だろう。",
		"　一部始終を目撃していた何者かは、跡形もなく住宅地の闇に消えていた。",
		"「ああもう、結界にあいつの感触なんてなかったのに……！」",
		"　などと、文句を言ってみても学生服の人影が戻ってくる筈もない。",
		"　自分の情けなさを恨めしく思いながら、私は追跡を諦めた。",
		"　一時的にしろ、公園は有珠の“森”になっている。",
		"　ここでは一メートル以内にいようと人物像の特定、声の確認はあやふやになる。なにしろ童話の中の出来事だ。",
		"　一連の出来事は見られたが、私や彼女の顔や素性は知られていない―――なら、他に打つ手はある。",
		"「あの背中、男だった」",
		"　公園に戻る。",
		"　見慣れていて当然で、アレは間違いなくうちの高校の制服だ。",
		"　手がかりとしてはそれで十分。うちの生徒なら洗いだす手段はいくらでもある。",
		"「……にしても。どうしてこう問題ばっかり増えていくんだろう」",
		"　などと愚痴りつつも、解決の優先順位ははっきりしていた。",
		"　変な噂をばらまかれるより早く、さっきの目撃者の口を封じなくてはいけない。",
		"　それも最優先で、迅速に、容赦なく。",
		"　顔を上げると、離れていた有珠の姿が見えた。",
		"　魔術師としてのあり方を目撃され、ピンチなのは彼女も同じなのに、",
		"「……これは、困った事になったわね」",
		"　人影の走り去った闇を見つめる姿は、冷静というより彫像か何かのように無反応。",
		"　……本当、うんざりする。",
		"　抑揚のないその声は、月の無い晩に、憎らしいほど似合っていた。"

		"  Let me tell you...",
		" ...how the events of yesterday transpired.",
		"  \"On moonless nights, you must never look back.\"",
		"  Was it a lesson or was it a warning?",
		"  It was so very long ago. At the time, I could not have imagined what I, what my very being, would become.",
		"  One night, it came without warning. I was filled with an anxiety so heightened that it made me want to burst into tears, so I fled to my grandfather's workshop.",
		"  Unlike the grandfather I knew, he smiled and kindly placed his hand upon my head.",
		"  \"...Yes, the red death follows your every step.\"",
		"  Rather than consoling me, he sent me home with only those haunting words.",
		"  That night, I am certain that I sensed a shadow lurking behind me.",
		"  Something or someone watching me from afar...",
		"  Then little by little, year by year, it drew closer.",
		"  Eventually, the presence that once felt like a spot on the horizon grew so close that I could feel its breath down the base of my neck.",
		"  Of course it was all in my mind.",
		"  When I turned around, nobody was there.",
		"  But that night marked the beginning.",
		"  In hindsight, I later understood that the indescribable anxiety I felt was the dread of certain death.",
		"\"",
		"...Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle,",
		"  The cow jumped over the moon,",
		"  The little dog laugh'd...\"",
		"  ...How much time has passed since that night?",
		"  It lingered deep in the recesses of my mind where childhood memories are kept.",
		"  A faded, story book-esque memory.",
		"  On dark nights, I still hear the faint echo of my grandfather's words.",
		"  But no matter how strong the wind may howl, or how entrancing the song of the girl next to me, I could never bury his ominous words completely.",
		"\"...It's here.\"",
		"  The girl beside me said.",
		"  Alice's inflectionless voice spoke volumes of her role as the bystander.",
		"  That night, there was only me and her.",
		"  It was the night I would mark as the birth of who I am today.",
		"  For what should have been quite the memorable night, it sure wasn't a promising start.",
		"  Dense clouds blocked the starlight above like a black umbrella.",
		"  Strong wind tore through the sky, carrying the heavy clouds with it.",
		"  The hands on the clock in the middle of the park pointed skyward, as if reaching for the moon.",
		"  Unfortunately for them, tonight there was no moon to point at.",
		"  The winter air grew fiercer as the night wore on.",
		"  Inhaling felt as though it would freeze me from the inside.",
		"  The air chilled me to the bone, threatening to pass up my spine directly to my brain.",
		"  To prevent my mind from being paralyzed,",
		"  and to prevent my fingertips from becoming stone,",
		"  I sparked a fire using my internal rhythm and emotion. ",
		"\"I'm transferring tactile feedback to you. ...Good luck.",
		"  Stand over there, and the engraved will-o'-the-wisp will ignite.\"",
		"  I responded to Alice with a nod.",
		"  And then, for just a moment, I saw the ground.",
		"  ...My legs quivered ever so faintly.",
		"  I told myself they were shaking from the cold, but I wasn't so sure.",
		"  In reality, they may not have been numbed by the cold, but by fear. I breathe a sigh of relief. My humanity must still be intact if my emotions are still present.",
		"  Before I could sink into a pool of my own sentimentality, the sensations from the Bounded Field flowed from Alice into me.",
		"  A transparent wall covered the entire park.",
		"  An unrecognizable carpet rooted deep under the earth.",
		"  Alice Kuonji's chants of the Mother Goose fairy tales permeated the night.",
		"  The sensations became one with my body.",
		"  I felt goosebumps on my quivering right arm.",
		"  Someone had trespassed.",
		"  The goosebumps crept up my right arm like ants,",
		"  and slowly but surely, made inroads for my heart.",
		"  Holding back the desire to drive them out, I waited for them to reach a certain, definitive position.",
		"  A moonless night.",
		"  The park's quaint street lights were not enough to lift the darkness.",
		"  The ants came to a stop.",
		"  Far, far from my right arm, they had reached my very heart.",
		"  Even without the aid of my sense of sight, I could see the intruder lurking in the darkness.",
		"  To starboard, in the bushes about thirty steps back, on all fours. It was beckoning with its right hand.",
		"\"...There!\"",
		"  The enemy's movement and my perception of it were in lockstep.",
		"  I spun around.",
		"  The enemy's arm stretched out like a spear.",
		"  This lethal weapon, aimed at the back of my head, brushed my hair at breakneck speed.",
		"  With the omniscient view granted by Alice's ward, I managed to avoid it by the skin of my teeth.",
		"  My hair fanned through the air from the violence of the attack.",
		"  An attack grazed my cheek and I felt a small, sharp pain.",
		"  It felt like the kiss of death.",
		"\"...!\"",
		"  I switched the flow of my body's blood to a different cycle.",
		"  The blood running through my veins at a few meter per second transmuted into an imaginary element.",
		"My body became a single circuit and my heart transformed into a completely different engine.",
		"  An unknowable motion of immeasurable heat.",
		"  A Mystic, yet untapped by humankind, that made me who I am.",
		"  The fire of life behind all miracles and fables.",
		"  This is what we mages call magical energy.",
		"\"...Set.\"",
		"  I turned around, set the enemy in my sights, and held up one hand.",
		"  My arm was the agent of my will.",
		"  My lack of experience meant my magecraft would only be possible with the use of vocalizations and gestures.",
		"  Magical formulae were engraved all over the park.",
		"  All I had to do was ignite them.",
		"  I needed to direct the flow of the magical energy within my body into each formula.",
		"  Typically, a mage acts as a conduit. Whether wired or wireless, the mage simply pours magical energy into the formula.",
		"  Releasing this energy in the form of a projectile, stream, or any number of other methods would usually suffice, but in my case...",
		" It was the feeling of my limbs whipping out!",
		"\"Burn!\"",
		"  I fought speed with speed.",
		"  The enemy's arm, extended few meter forward, became engulfed in flames.",
		"  It was nighttime at the park. The scene, reminiscent of a campfire, but one in which the center of the flames contained a humanoid figure wriggling like a shadow puppet.",
		"  The flame subsided just as unnaturally as it had ignited.",
		"  No crackling, no burning smell.",
		"\"You can have the Bounded Field back. I'll check the remains.\"",
		"  After telling this to Alice, I headed toward the motionless figure.",
		"  I killed it.",
		"I killed it.",
		"I killed it.",
		"  Regardless of who my opponent was, I just took someone's life.",
		"  My throat parched, I swallowed the truth that without this sense of reality I would have been helpless.",
		"So hard and bitter, impossible to swallow...but I tried to anyway.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  I was unnervingly calm. My heart pounded and my breath felt heavy, but my mind was nonetheless calm.",
		"  By the time I realized it, the charred remains were already in front of me.",
		"  Bracing for a counter-attack, I carefully examined the corpse.",
		"  Everything seemed fine. This body lying slumped to the ground, was nothing but ash.",
		"\"...?\"",
		"  But something wasn't right.",
		"  To begin with, its remains didn't smell organic.",
		"  Not willing to believe my hunch, I took a closer look at the corpse's face.",
		"  All that greeted me was the featureless white face of a mannequin.",
		"\"Damn it, they got us again!\"",
		"  Screaming, I kicked the mannequin.",
		"  The corpse crumbled to ash and disappeared with the wind.",
		"No, this was no corpse. This was just a puppet, and for all our efforts to lure the master out, we had once again been tricked by a familiar.",
		"  My debut, my first test out in the open, would be postponed for another day.",
		"\"Argh...",
		" Will I ever pass this test...?",
		" ...What?\"",
		"  At that moment, I suddenly noticed something familiar in the corner of my eye.",
		"  Something seemed strange about the slide on the other end of the park. It appeared as though its shadow were larger than it should be.",
		"  Was I still drunk on the high of battle?",
		"  It took me a second to realize what it was.",
		"\"Who's there?!\"",
		"  Calling out was a mistake.",
		"  Startled by my voice, the figure, wearing a familiar high school uniform, took a step back, and then...",
		" It broke into a sprint.",
		"  Like someone running for their life.",
		"  ...Or should I say, he was doing exactly that!",
		"\"After him! We've been spotted!\"",
		"  In a rush, I shouted to my partner, but she hadn't even noticed the third party's presence in the first place.",
		"  Though, it wasn't as if I could move by myself. Embarrassingly, the fight had taken more out of me than I'd have liked...!",
		"\"No, he'll get away!",
		"  We need to catch and eliminate him!\"",
		"  There was no time for niceties.",
		"  For us, being seen here was a matter of life and death!",
		"\"Wait, get back here you...!\"",
		"  Shaking off the numbness in my legs, I made for the park's exit.",
		"  I had to admire his escape.",
		"  The witness, party to the entire night's proceedings, had disappeared into the darkness of the residential district without a trace.",
		"\"Why the hell didn't I sense him in the field?!\"",
		"  Complaining to myself wouldn't bring back the figure in uniform.",
		"  Bitter at my own incompetence, I gave up the chase.",
		"  Though temporary, the park had become Alice's \"woods.\"",
		"  For anyone within a one meter of the park, other park-goers' identifiable features and voices became murky, like the stuff of fairy tales.",
		"  Tonight's proceedings may have had a witness, but if our identities were still hidden... Then this was still a chance.",
		"\"That looked like a male from behind.\"",
		"  I returned to the park.",
		"  That uniform was, without a doubt, from my high school.",
		"  That was clue enough. If he was a schoolmate of mine, I had plenty of methods to flush him out.",
		"\"...It's one thing after another.\"",
		"  Amidst my grumbling, I set my priorities straight.",
		"  Before some strange rumors spread, I needed to seal the witness's mouth shut.",
		"  That was the highest priority. Quickly and without mercy.",
		"  Looking up, I saw Alice's previously distant figure.",
		"  Though she was in as much trouble as I was with her existence as a magus also exposed, she had but one thing to say.",
		"\"...This means trouble.\"",
		"  Her statue-like figure, staring into the darkness, seemed more expressionless than calm.",
		"  ...I was pissed off.",
		"  Her inscrutable voice resembled the moonless night so much it made me angry."
