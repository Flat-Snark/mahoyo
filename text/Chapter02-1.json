		"　良いか悪いかで言えば、間違いなく良い部類に入る時間だ。",

		"　貴重な昼休みを一分一秒も無駄にしない。",
		"　かたちは違えど、両陣営の信念は同じだった。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　その手際の良さに草十郎は呆気に取られている。",
		"　転入してから十日経った今でもこのスピーディーさについていけず、いまだ自分の席に居座っていた。",
		"「おーい、こっちこいよ静希！」",
		"　呼びかけてくる声は、教室の窓側を占拠した一大食卓からだった。",

		"「おまえな、ひとりで何個も食えるもんじゃねえぞアレ。うまいのは最初の一個だけだって」",

		"　賞味期限を油性のサインペンで塗りつぶされたソレは、ある男子生徒の家の倉庫から発掘されたものらしい。",

		"「あ、マンゴー余ったら回してほしいなー」",
		"「ばか、肉食え肉。そんなんだから貧弱な体してんだぞ、おまえら！」",
		"　飛びかう声に、やっぱり草十郎はついていけない。",
		"「……分かるのは、どっちも破滅的だってコトだけだ」",
		"　言いつつ、草十郎はどちらも断りきれない。",

		"　オラ、おまえらもな、善良な羊を悪の園に引きずりこんでんじゃねえよ」",
		"　場違いにドスのきいた声が、草十郎の背後から教室に響きわたる。",
		"「副会長」",
		"　草十郎が振り向くと、そこには彼より頭ひとつぶん背の高い男子生徒が立っていた。",
		"　乱雑に、けれど見栄えよく撫で上げられた長髪。",
		"　整った美形でありながら刺々しい目つきでクラスを<睥睨|へいげい>する暴力性。",
		"　いつも眠そうな草十郎とは対照的な、一目で人を魅了する非の打ちどころのない美男子。",

		"「へへへ、ここは見てのとおりボンクラどもが集う貧民街でございますよ、王子はほら、Ａ組のきれいどころとカフェでお茶でもしてればいいじゃない！」",
		"「また静希呼びに来たのかよ。青子女史といい鳶丸殿下といい、静希、なんかヤバいコトしちゃったのか……？」",
		"「えー。静希くんは校則違反しないじゃん。",
		"　ちょっと、それ以外のルール破るだけで！」",
		"「ってコトはやっぱり―――<槻司|つきじ>くん、蒼崎に振られてからそっちに走ったって本当だったのね!?」",
		"「………………」",
		"　この通り、親愛と友情に満ちた暴言だった。",
		"　言われたい放題の男子に、草十郎はつい同情してしまう。",
		"　もっとも、肝心の男子はまったくのノーリアクション。",
		"　騒ぎ立てる彼らをつまらなげに<一瞥|いちべつ>すると、吐き捨てるように声をあげる。",
		"「相変わらず無駄に元気があって結構じゃねえかテメエら。",
		"　そんなに活力たぎってんなら冬期特別清掃班にだって参加出来るよなあ、",
		"オイ？",
		"　いまんところ自主的に申し出てるのは全校で一人しかいねえんだ。２－Ｃ全員が参加すりゃあ、俺も蒼崎も肩の荷がおりるってもんなんだがよ……！」",
		"　その端整な顔立ちとはかけ離れた、ドスのきいた<胴間|どうま>声が教室に響く。",
		"　彼の一喝で水を打ったように黙りこむ、ならず者部隊＆スイーツ愛好者たち。",
		"　この男子生徒を畏怖しての事もあるが、何より『冬期特別清掃班』が恐ろしいからである。",
		"　冬期特別清掃班。",
		"　それは先々代の生徒会からお手上げ状態で放置していた旧校舎、および山みたいな裏庭の森を冬休みを挙げて清掃しよう、という趣旨の、学園行事の名を借りた拷問だ。",
		"　おそらく、冬休みのうち三日は完全に潰される。",
		"　もちろん成績に残るような見返りはない。",
		"　ことはあくまで生徒会が立案しただけのボランティア。参加希望者が一人でもいたコトは奇跡に近い。",
		"「あー……いや、僕ら、ちょっと体弱いんで……すみっちょで缶詰食べてますね？」",
		"「わたしたちも貧血気味で……こうやって果物たべてないと死んじゃうっていうか……冬休みはもう予定いっぱいっていうか……」",
		"　一名を除いて、そそくさと隅に移動する２年Ｃ組の皆さん。",
		"「よし、昼食はやっぱり静かにやらねえとな。",
		"　一年坊主の教室より二年の教室の方がやかましいなんて苦情、いいかげんにしやがれよアホウども？」",
		"　うへーい、と弱々しく退散する有象無象たち。",
		"　その中に溶け込むように流れていく草十郎だったが、",
		"「おう、おまえはこっちだ草十郎。ちょい顔貸せ」",
		"　強引に肩を引かれ、仲間入りを阻まれた。",
		"「……っだよ、生徒会横暴ー。人んちのテーブルマナーまで指図してほしくねーよなー！」",
		"　立ち去る背中を好機と見たのか、仲間うちでのみ聞こえるよう悪態をつく木乃美。",
		"「ああ？　上等じゃねえか木乃美、いいぜ、おまえが記念すべき二人目だ。冬休み、首を洗って待ってやがれ」",
		"　きっかり聞こえていたのか、副会長は親指をたてて、ぐるん、と<一回転|ノックアウト>の意を示す。",
		"「はあ、なに言ってんですかアイツ？",
		"　アレ自主的なイベントじゃん、いくら副会長ったって強制はできないですよねぇ!?」",
		"　ひひひ、と笑う２年Ｃ組の誇る問題児。",
		"「そりゃ昨日までの話だ。",
		"　会長の提案が学校側に受理されてな、本日付けで生徒会役員は強制力のある推薦権をもらえたんだよ。",
		"　とくに会長と副会長の推薦は絶対だ。拒否した場合、学校側はともかく、蒼崎がなにするか俺には止められねえからそのつもりでな？」",
		"@o「げぇぇぇ!!!?　ちょ、それ事実上の死刑宣告じゃん!?　生徒^会まじ横暴ー！！！！」",
		"　悪態から悲鳴に変わる木乃美の断末魔を後に、副会長と草十郎は２年Ｃ組を後にした。",
		"「おまえも大変だな、草十郎」",
		"「あんたもわりと暇なんだな、副会長」",
		"　無人の生徒会室に入るなり所感を口にするふたり。",
		"　三咲高校の生徒会室は二つあり、",
		"　一つは生徒会用に作られた大部屋、",
		"　もう一つは数学の準備室だった資料室とに分かれている。",
		"　こちらは資料室の方で、壁にはファイルのつまった資料棚がびっしりと並び、ただでさえ狭苦しい部屋を余計に窮屈に見せていた。",
		"　生徒会室というより、個人の隠れ家といった方が正しいだろう。",
		"　草十郎が椅子に座ると、向かい合うように男子生徒も腰を下ろした。",
		"　<槻司|つきじ><鳶丸|とびまる>。",
		"　私立三咲高校の理事長の息子であり、生徒会副会長。",
		"　学年は草十郎と同じく二年生で、約一週間前、転入生の世話を生徒会長に押しつけられてからの付き合いである。",
		"「副会長はやめろって。クソッタレな話だが、俺はしょせん会長の犬だからな」",
		"　やれやれと自嘲するも、不満があるワケでもなさそうだ。",
		"　鳶丸はポケットからスナック菓子を取りだし、実にまずそうに口に入れた。",
		"　一本１００キロカロリーほどのブロック形式の簡易食を、それこそ干し肉を引きちぎるように片づけていく。",
		"「そうか。でも犬はよくないな、鳶丸」",
		"　難しい顔つきで草十郎は椅子に座る。",
		"「あん？　犬がどうしたって？」",
		"「犬はよくないって言った。喩えが違う気がするし、なにより怖いぞ、アレ」",
		"「？　なんだよ、山奥育ちのくせに犬が怖いのか？」",
		"「そりゃたいていの生き物は怖いけど、犬は別格だ。",
		"　徒党を組んだ野犬ほど始末に負えないものはない。",
		"　<脚|あし>の速さも脅威だけど、なにより執念深すぎる。",
		"　坂だろうと追いかけてくるし、最後の一匹になるまで引かないんだぞ」",
		"　などと言いつつ、弁当の包みを開ける草十郎。",
		"　若草色をした布には、綺麗な三角形をしたおにぎりが三つ包まれていた。",
		"「……ショックだ」",
		"「？　ショックってなにが？」",
		"「いや、そんな、この世のものとは思えない握り飯を見たのは初めてだ。思わず絶句しちまった」",
		"「……。それ、どっちなんだ？」",
		"「誉めてるんだよ、馬鹿」",
		"　草十郎を相手に侮辱とも称賛とも取れる言い回しはこういう結果を招く。婉曲な表現、遠回しな嫌味をかみ砕ける<機微|きび>がないためだ。",
		"　ただ、今のように言葉の良し悪しをいちいち訊ねるのは<希|まれ>だった。",
		"　鳶丸の推測だが、この少年は個人的に<譲|ゆず>れない事のみ白黒をハッキリさせる気質らしい。",
		"「ところで。その固まった小麦粉みたいなの、美味しいのか？」",
		"　興味津々とばかりに鳶丸の簡易食を見つめる草十郎。",
		"「まずくはねえが美味くもねえよ。ま、試してみる分には止めねえが。",
		"　人間、何事も手間暇惜しむようになっちゃおしまいだぜ。事が三大欲求ならなおさらだ」",
		"　鳶丸はガリガリとブロック菓子を平らげ、残った一本を机に置き、当然という手つきでおにぎりを一つ手に取った。",
		"　草十郎も当然とばかりに鳶丸の暴挙を見逃し、差し出されたブロック菓子を食べてみる。",
		"「……なんだか、土を食べてるみたいだ」",
		"「違いない。遊びを無くせば人生こんなもんだって見本だな」",
		"　草十郎は苦い顔のまま、律儀に簡易食をかじっていく。",
		"　未知への関心と、はじめた事はきっちり終わらせようとする律儀さである。",
		"「いま無理に平らげる必要はねえぞ。そいつの利点は携帯食ってところだからな。素で味けないが、食えるうちは味が落ちないのがいいところだ。",
		"　ま、そっちはともかく。どうだ、少しは慣れたか？」",
		"「ああ。鳶丸や蒼崎が気を遣ってくれているからね」",
		"　屈託のない笑顔に、鳶丸はつい顔をそらしてしまった。",
		"　草十郎はたしかに普段からぼんやりしているが、反面、こうして見せる感情表現はまっすぐで嘘がない。",
		"　鳶丸のように若く利己的な人間にとっては、ささやかな毒にもなる。",
		"『……だから蒼崎はこねえんだよなあ……』",
		"　内心呟いて、手にした握り飯を一口かじる鳶丸。",
		"　冷めた白米でありながら、しっかり柔らかな食感である事に二度驚く鳶丸だった。",
		"「……ん？　",
		"いや待て、気を遣ってんのは俺だけじゃねえか。蒼崎なんておまえが転入した日に“彼、迷惑だから見張ってて”の一言だけだぞ!?」",
		"「……なんでそこで君が怒るんだ？」",
		"「いや、だからだな。おまえが学校に慣れるよう陰ながら見守ってんのは俺で、蒼崎は生徒会室で全校生徒の弱みを集めてるだけって話だ！",
		"　面倒な苦労してんのは俺だけじゃねえかって―――」",
		"　そこまで口にして、鳶丸は自分の言い分が馬鹿らしくなった。草十郎の言う通り、鳶丸が怒る筋合いでもない。",
		"「……ま、いいさ。蒼崎に言いつけられなきゃこうなる事もなかったしな。",
		"　知ってるか？",
		"　あいつ、どうして俺にこんな役させたと思う？」",
		"「副会長だからだろ」",
		"　言われて、鳶丸はその綺麗な顔を曇らせる。",
		"「あのなあ。どうして副会長が転入生ひとりにかかりっきりにならなくちゃいけねえんだよ。",
		"　チッ、いいぜ、機会があったら蒼崎本人に聞いてみな。あいつの本性が分かるからよ」",
		"　鳶丸は悪態をつきながらさらに握り飯をかじる。",
		"　乾燥した米粒でありながら、なんという<瑞々|みずみず>しさ……言うなれば<握|にぎ>り飯ではなく<包|つつ>み飯。力任せに米を固めたのではなく、職人の業で優しく『おにぎり』というカタチに集結させたとしか思えない……",
		"「そしてなによりこの塩加減、中の具からしみだした玄妙な醤油加減はどうだ―――",
		"食欲をそそるどころか、脳を食欲だけにするような―――",
		"おお―――」",
		"「鳶丸、思ってる事が口に出てるみたいだけど」",
		"「いや、それほどのショックだったってワケだ。",
		"　なあ草の字。これ、具はなんだ？」",
		"　予想外の味に思わず訊ねる。",
		"　ちなみに、鳶丸はまだ外周だけで中心たる具に辿り着いていない。",
		"「ああ、それはイナゴ」",
		"「ありえねえ！」",
		"　がは、と咳きこむ副会長。",
		"　たしかに、山奥育ちの草十郎には海の幸より山の幸のイメージがあるような、でもイナゴはないような。",
		"「クソ、食う前に言えよな！　信じられねえぐらい美味いと思っちまったじゃねえか！」",
		"「ああ、今のは嘘だよ」",
		"　瞬間、見つめ合うふたり。",
		"「ほんとは鮭。いくらなんでも、イナゴはね」",
		"「―――お、おう。そうだよな、いや、安心した。",
		"　いくらなんでもイナゴはねえよな」",
		"「ああ、こんな都会で身のしまったイナゴが手に入るもんか」",
		"「………………」",
		"　気になる台詞だったが、あえて鳶丸はスルーする。",
		"「……ったく。どっちにしても冗談きついぜ。あやうくはき出すところだったじゃねえか。らしくねえぞ、草十郎」",
		"「君が蒼崎の悪口を言うからだ」",
		"　瞼を閉じ、不機嫌そうに握り飯を食べながら草十郎はそう言った。たしかに言った。",
		"　不満そうにもぐもぐ口を動かす草十郎を、鳶丸は<唖然|あぜん>と見つめる。",
		"「―――おい。今のはさすがに聞き捨てならねえぞ。俺が蒼崎の悪口を言ったから<意趣返|いしゅがえ>しをしたと、そういうコトか？」",
		"「………………」",
		"　もぐもぐもぐ。",
		"　純朴な田舎少年の無言の抗議は、ますます真実味を増していく。",
		"　間違いない、なんという悲劇、と副会長は落雷を受けたかのような頭痛にもだえた。",
		"「なんてこった。おまえ、まさか蒼崎に惚れてんのか？",
		"　そうなのか？　そうなんだな!?　おい、眠ってねえで起きろ！」",
		"　椅子から立ち上がり、草十郎の両肩を激しくシェイクする鳶丸。",
		"　仕方なく、むっとした顔で草十郎は目を開けた。",
		"「そうか……おまえは一年前の惨劇を知らないんだな。",
		"　知ってりゃ、そんなストレートな破滅願望を持つ事もなかったろうに」",
		"「……君の言葉には誤解が含まれてるけど、それは後にする。それより、一年前の惨劇って？」",
		"「―――む」",
		"　鳶丸はハッと我に返り、どうしたものかと考えたあげく、どすんと椅子に座る。",
		"「仕方ねえ。この手の噂をするのは好きじゃねえんだけどな」",
		"　しかしそれも青少年の輝かしい未来のためだ、と鳶丸は自己肯定した。",
		"「あれは蒼崎がまだ一年の頃の話だ。",
		"　あの頃はみんな入学したばっかりで、蒼崎がどんな性格か誰も知らなかった。",
		"　あいつ、外見は文句なしに美人だからな。",
		"　そりゃあ男どもは狂喜乱舞したもんさ」",
		"　そして、後に違った意味で狂喜乱舞する事になるとは、誰ひとり夢にも思わなかったのである。",
		"「四月、五月はもう上を下への大騒ぎでよ。",
		"　あの時ばかりは上級生も下級生もなかったな。",
		"　野郎同士の牽制、共闘、はては決闘まで、まあよくも騒いだもんさ。蒼崎に近寄るだけでも大変だったんだぜ？」",
		"「？　なんでそんなよく分からない事態になるんだ？」",
		"「そりゃ蒼崎はひとりきり、命知らずな野郎はのべ百人ほどいたからだよ。",
		"　ひとりひとり蒼崎とランチしても三ヶ月かかるだろ？",
		"　だから、まずは男同士でつまんねえ暗闘があったのさ」",
		"「…………」",
		"「ま、いい。分からねえんならそこは飛ばそう。<所詮|しょせん>負け犬どもの話だしな、本筋にはなりえねえ」",
		"「でな。そんなどうでもいい戦いを勝ち残ったヤツらは列なして一年の女に言い寄ったワケだ。",
		"　蒼崎はアレでなんていうか、相手のなけなしの誠意？　じゃなくてアレか、勇気？　そういうの、無視できずに認めちまうヤツだからな。",
		"　言い寄ってくる相手を可能なかぎり丁寧に断ってた」",
		"「が、中にはそれで勘違いしちまう奴もいてよ。",
		"　三年のある野郎がこれは脈アリと見て蒼崎に何度も言い寄ったんだよ。",
		"　……たぶん、そいつ頭がおかしかったんだ。今にして思うと、そうとしか思えん」",
		"　ちなみに、その三年生とやらが前期の生徒会長である事を、鳶丸は秘する事にした。",
		"「学園ばかりか蒼崎の家まで押しかけたそうでな。",
		"あまりにしつこいんで蒼崎も堪忍袋の緒が切れたんだろう。ちょっと、口にするのは<憚|はばか>られる方法でふったんだよ」",
		"「結果、そいつは自分から他校に転入希望したばかりか三咲町からも逃げ出しちまって、蒼崎も一ヶ月ばかり自宅謹慎を食らった。",
		"　世に言う血の公会堂事件だ。",
		"　詳しく知りたけりゃ本人………はまずいな、新聞部にでもいけ。あそこの部長は命知らずだから、訊けば面白がって教えてくれる」",
		"「……鳶丸。その、具体的な表現を故意に避けてないか？」",
		"「仕方ねえだろ。理事長の息子だろうが何だろうが怖いものは怖ぇし、高校ぐらいは無事卒業しとかねえとな。",
		"　うちの女子の制服みるたびに奇声をあげるトラウマなんて持ちたくねえよ」",
		"「………………」",
		"　むう、と納得いかなげに首をかしげる草十郎。",
		"　鳶丸の言わんとするところが、彼にはさっぱり分からない。",
		"「まあいい。",
		"　それより、なんで蒼崎なんかがいいんだよ、草十郎」",
		"　言われて、今度は逆の方向に、はて、と草十郎は首をかしげた。",
		"「おい。おまえ、本当に蒼崎が好きなのか？",
		"　たんに胸がドキドキいってるだけなら、それは恋じゃなくて恐怖だってオチもあるぜ。いくら草の字がぼんやりでも理由ってもんがあるだろ？」",
		"　草十郎はさらに首をかしげる。",
		"　鳶丸の言い分には<語弊|ごへい>があるが、とりあえず今はそれを抜きにするとして。",
		"　草十郎自身、蒼崎青子に抱く感情には理解できないものが多すぎた。",
		"「そうだな、おかしい。俺は、あまり彼女を知らないのにね」",
		"　それもその筈、創立記念日の案内以来、学園内において草十郎と青子は一度も話していないのだ。",
		"　草十郎が話し掛けようとすると青子は素早く立ち去ってしまう。",
		"　この間の日曜日には縁あって労働を共にしたが、あれだって往復時間に軽く話した程度である。",
		"「けど鳶丸、君は知らないだけなんだ。",
		"　時々なんだが、誰かの視線を感じて振り返ってみると、いつ失敗するかを心配して見ている人がいる。",
		"　鳶丸の言うとおり、ただ廊下で俺を見かけて、たんに監視していただけなのかも知れない。本当は俺の事なんて気にせず素通りしたいのかも知れない。",
		"　けど、どんな種類であれ彼女の心配は本物だ」",
		"「それに、ここが一番大事だと思うんだけど。",
		"　実際の話、蒼崎のそういうところのおかげで、俺は助かっていたりするんだ」",
		"　何の気負いもなく、真剣に彼は言った。",
		"　それを聞いた鳶丸は軽い後悔と共に、ため息などをこぼしてしまう。",
		"　今の台詞さえ聞かなければ適当な女生徒を紹介して、草十郎が平穏な高校生活を送れるよう段取っただろうに。",
		"　本来、彼がそこまで男友達のために骨折るコトはない。",
		"　利用できる相手なら損得のために騙しあい、助け合う。",
		"　利用できない人間は、そも利用するべきではないと判断して距離を置くのが槻司鳶丸の信念だ。",
		"　そんな彼をして、静希草十郎は益を得る相手ではないクセに、手を貸したくなる人種だった。",
		"　彼は友情には<疎|うと>くなかったが、",
		"　友人と呼べる人物にはそう恵まれていなかった。",
		"　……なので、草十郎が本気で青子に惚れているのなら、友人として、それを改めさせる野暮はできなかった。",
		"「……やれやれ。結局、惚れてる奴にゃあ理由なんていらねえんだな」",
		"「そんな事はない。理由ならひとつある。",
		"　彼女を<一目|ひとめ>みた時に、綺麗だなって思ったぞ」",
		"「あ？」",
		"　がくん、と肩を落とす鳶丸。",
		"「なんだぁ!?　あんだけ恥ずかしい台詞いっといて、要は外見に惚れてますだあ？　結局見てくれかよ草十郎！」",
		"「綺麗なものに見惚れるのは、いいことじゃないのか？",
		"　自分を綺麗に見せる努力をしているんだから、外見から内面を判断するのは、そんなおかしな話じゃないと思う」",
		"「む」",
		"　詭弁のようではあるが、なんとなく正論のような気もする。",
		"「……しょうがねえ、分かったよ。この話はもう止めよう。草の字が誰を<自分|テメエ>の女にするか、俺の知った事じゃねえし」",
		"　さて。",
		"　ここで、鳶丸はひとつ、大きな勘違いをしていた。",
		"　静希草十郎は蒼崎青子に好意を持っているだけであって、別に、心の底から好きだとか、恋人として付き合いたいなんて願望は、むしろ一片も無かった、という点である。",
		"　この勘違いが後に大きな禍根となるコトを、神ならざる彼らが気付くよしもない。",
		"「だがよ、ひとつだけ忠告しておくぜ草十郎。",
		"蒼崎はケンカをした相手だろうと別に嫌うワケじゃない。逆に言えば、親切にしたって別に好かれるワケでもない。",
		"いい例が俺だ」",
		"　過去の傷心を思いだしたのか、鳶丸は重いため息とともに語る。",
		"「そうか、",
		"詳しく」",
		"「おう。昔な、あいつがあんまりに独善的だったんでつい手をあげかけちまった事がある。",
		"　半年前の夏だ。一年もあいつと生徒会やってたもんだから、俺も女っつーより戦友って気になっててな。",
		"　つい勢いで平手打ちをしようと右手をあげた。―――我ながら四番<打者|バッター>もかくやという腰のひねり。たしかな実感とともに、俺は勝利を確信したもんさ」",
		"　ふっ、と遠い目をする彼は、その後の<顛末|てんまつ>を話そうとはしなかった。",
		"「翌日になって、こりゃあ完全に敵扱いされたな、と覚悟して生徒会室にいってみりゃあ、蒼崎はいつも通りだった。",
		"　で、以来あいつと俺は会長と副会長で納まってる」",
		"　話を聞き終わり、ふーん、と感想を漏らす草十郎。",
		"　そうして自信を持って、",
		"「いまの話を総合すると、君はたんに<惚気|のろけ>たいのか？」",
		"　真顔で、まったく分かってない感想を口にするのだった。",

		"\"The city is really strange,",
		"  but a pretty easy place to live, once you get the hang of it.\"",
		"  Soujuurou sighed listlessly.",
		"  He looked down at the winter schoolyard below, lost in thought.",
		"  \"December\" was written on the corner of the chalkboard.",
		"  He could not believe ten days had already passed since he transferred to the school.",
		"  The last vestiges of autumn had faded with the change of the month.",
		"  The trees were all but barren, and the ground below them a mat of fallen leaves.",
		"  Fourth period was classics.",
		"  An elderly teacher stood at the lectern and rambled on.",
		"  While he had finally gotten used to the classroom, he still had a long way to go to get up to speed in his classes.",
		"  Lacking even the basic understanding most students learn in their early scholastic life, it was a battle for Soujuurou to keep up.",
		"  Even if he was unable to grasp all of the content right away, he at least tried to memorize everything in the hope that he could make use of it down the road.",
		"  Which is why losing himself in his thoughts was about the last thing he should have been doing.",
		"  He would normally chastise himself for daydreaming, but...",
		"\"...Hah.\"",
		"  Troublingly, he was unable to concentrate in class today.",
		"  Soujuurou could not place the source of his lack of concentration.",
		"  It could not have been the winter in the city; it was much milder than in the mountains. Neither was his part-time job particularly tiring.",
		"  He was not any more physically fatigued than the average student, so that could not be it either.",
		"  Others might conclude that it was because the courses were boring, but that seemed off the mark, too.",
		"  Soujuurou did not share his classmates' opinions about their classes.",
		"  On the contrary, he rather enjoyed his class time.",
		"  No, his frame of mind was not to blame either.",
		"  Trying to figure out what was wrong only made him more depressed.",
		"(What's wrong with me? It's not like me to be so distracted.)",
		"  He scolded himself and turned his attention to the chalkboard.",
		"  The rhythmic ticks of the chalk were sending him into a slumber, but he somehow managed to resist their lullaby.",
		"  And yet, he was still unable to focus on the class.",
		"(...Ugh.)",
		"  Soujuurou reflected silently as was his custom, and sighed inwardly.",
		"  Deep down he knew the real source of his agitation.",
		"  The events of the previous night were the only thing it could be.",
		"  With the chime to signal the end of class, the teacher bowed and exited into the hallway.",
		"  To see him off, the thirty or so students all stood up from their desks.",
		"  The clock, which had seemed to slow dramatically around half-past eleven, now struck noon.",
		"  The tension seemed to fade from the room all at once.",
		"  The release from a difficult lesson",
		"  was the start of lunchtime-the highlight of school life.",
		"  Misaki High's cafeteria was not particularly known for its quality of food.",
		"  Complaints that the quality was below that of a private school went unheeded,",
		"  and the same \"unique\" flavors appeared on the menu each and every day.",
		"  Private school prices coupled with subpar quality led the majority of students to opt for boxed lunches instead.",
		"  Soujuurou's Class 2-C was no exception.",
		"  The boys muscled as many as ten desks into what resembled a long dining table.",
		"  Conversely, the girls divided themselves into smaller tables of two or three desks with practiced ease, and started chatting within their cliques.",
		"  Not a single student wasted even a second of their precious lunchtime.",
		"  Where both sides differed in method, they shared a common goal.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou was struck dumb by the efficiency of the transformation.",
		"  Even after ten days, he was unable to keep pace with the rest of the class and remained seated where he had sat during the previous period.",
		"\"Hey, Shizuki! Over here!\"",
		"  The voice came from the large makeshift dining table near the window.",
		"  Housuke Kinomi was beckoning him over while leaning back in his chair in a way that looked like he could fall backward at any second.",
		"  He was regularly shot down by others in the class for being lazy and crass, but his earnest nature kept him from getting on anyone's bad side.",
		"  Though something could be said for not being so forthcoming all the time, too.",
		"\"Times-a-wastin'! Let's eat!",
		"  I've got a bunch of leftover spring rolls from yesterday, but when my dad saw 'em, he told me I shouldn't waste 'em, so that's the only thing I've got.\"",
		"  It seemed his end game was to find someone who might take pity on him and trade him for something better.",
		"  The two of them worked at the same restaurant, so he was one of the few people Soujuurou knew before starting school.",
		"  He was also the reason Soujuurou was able to learn the true meaning of the phrase \"can't live with them, can't live without them.\"",
		"\"Yeah, Shizuki! Get your butt over here! It's the long-awaited Canned Food Festival today!\"",
		"\"So we're really going through with this? We're absolutely sure we wanna do this?\"",
		"\"You bet your ass we are! Sure, the stuff is processed to hell, but all the canned crab you can eat?! This ain't no sardines in a can, dude!\"",
		"\"You for real?! Then hell yeah! Count me in!",
		"  Is there enough corned beef for everyone? Or is it first come, first served?\"",
		"\"That's not somethin' you can eat a ton of, ya know. Only the first can tastes any good.\"",
		"\"With Shizuki on board, we'd be at an even seven cans a piece. What a lifesaver...\"",
		"\"So what's up with your lunch, Kinomi? It looks harder than the cans.\"",
		"  The boys usually passed the time by making fun of each other's lunches, but today they were united against a common foe.",
		"  A pyramid of countless cans stood in the middle of the table.",
		"  They had all been taken from the pantry of a certain student's house, and the expiration dates on them had all been scribbled out with a marker.",
		"\"All right, lads. Everyone got your can openers?",
		"  Eating them sucks! No one likes leftovers! But these metal demons must be slain at all costs, even if it means missing fifth period!",
		"  Oh, and a special thanks to our sponsors, Downtown McCoy and Nakayama Market!\"",
		"\"Yeah, baby! Let's eat!\"",
		"  The boys united as one and hoisted their can openers into the air.",
		"\"Eat up, Shizuki! There's enough can openers to go around!\"",
		"\"I thought I told you yesterday that I'm not interested in being your taste tester.",
		"  And besides, at least half of those cans are past their expiration date.\"",
		"\"Oh, c'mon! Live a little!\"",
		"  Quite an inexplicably excited group of guys.",
		"  Their real motivation seemed to be to spread the pain.",
		"  But moved by their energy and conceding defeat, Soujuurou got up from his seat and joined them.",
		"  And before he could...",
		"\"Hey! Give it a rest, why don't you?",
		"  Forget them, Shizuki! Come eat with us!\"",
		"  Another interested party joined the fray.",
		"  A girl with short but stylish hair had called out to him.",
		"  She had also tried to get Soujuurou to join the track and field club several days earlier.",
		"\"...Um, thanks for the offer, but I'd rather not.\"",
		"  He answered with a troubled look on his face.",
		"  On their table was nothing but a pile of fruit Soujuurou had never seen before.",
		"\"What? Whyyy? You don't like papayas?",
		"  We've got mango and coconut if you want something else! And don't tell anyone, but we've even got a Yubari melon!\"",
		"  The members of the fruit group pumped their fists in unison at that last delicacy.",
		"\"Wait, coconuts? Can you even eat those?\"",
		"\"Umm, I'd like a mango if you have any extra.\"",
		"\"Idiots! Meat! MEEEAT! Eatin' anything else is just gonna make ya weak!\"",
		"  Soujuurou couldn't keep track of all of the voices flying across the room.",
		"\"All I know is that nothing good will come out of either of these choices.\"",
		"  That being said, he found it difficult to refuse them outright.",
		"  His tendency to accept others' goodwill at face value occasionally left him frozen with indecision.",
		"  Not accustomed to regular human interaction, he was unable to judge when it was or was not appropriate to turn someone down.",
		"  Someone tapped the lost, little lamb on the shoulder.",
		"\"Don't mind them. If you get involved with every idiot who invites you to do something, you'll mess up your whole life. It's okay to turn them down, you know.",
		"  And you guys... Stop trying to lead this good soul over to the dark side!\"",
		"  An inappropriately loud voice echoed throughout the classroom from behind him.",
		"\"Vice-president.\"",
		"  Soujuurou turned around to see a boy about a head taller than him.",
		"  His long hair, while unkempt, had been brushed back, giving it an appealingly windswept look.",
		"  His attractive features belied the contempt for the classroom his eyes carried.",
		"  Unlike the perpetually dopey-looking Soujuurou, he was an extremely attractive boy, capable of captivating anyone who so much as glanced at him.",
		"  In most cases, such a boy's presence would be met with awe and respect. However...",
		"\"Oh look! Our mighty vice-president has graciously decided to pay us a visit!\"",
		"\"I thought you were going to take up residence in the cafeteria so you wouldn't have to see our stupid faces anymore!\"",
		"\"Hehehe, have you lost your way, Your Highness? You're slumming where the commoners eat gruel from their troughs. Shouldn't you be sipping tea with the babes from Class A?\"",
		"\"Why don't you leave Shizuki alone, huh? First Lady Aoko has it in for him, now His Highness too! What could he have done to have earned the attention of such royalty?\"",
		"\"Really?! But Shizuki's such a goody-two-shoes! He's never broken any rules!",
		"  Well, the rules of the school at least!\"",
		"\"Wait, could it be that...Tsukiji really switched teams after Aozaki rejected him!?\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  They continued to give him a hard time.",
		"  Soujuurou could not help but feel sorry for him.",
		"  The class vice-president, on the other hand, showed absolutely no reaction whatsoever.",
		"  He glared at them with a bored look and simply raised his voice.",
		"\"You freaks should get some new material.",
		"  Why don't you spend your time more productively for once? Like helping with the Special Winter Cleaning Team.",
		" Yeah, you heard me.",
		"  Only one student in the entire school has signed up so far! Having all of Class C with us would be a huge help, but I guess you want me and Aozaki to do all the work!\"",
		"  The menacing growl in his voice contrasted greatly with the boy's well-constructed looks.",
		"  Both Team Canned and Team Fruit's words were doused like a fire being smothered. ",
		"  This was partly due to their fear of the boy, but mostly due to their fear of the Special Winter Cleaning Team.",
		"  Yes, the Special Winter Cleaning Team.",
		"  Joining meant spending part of your winter break cleaning up the old school building and mountainous rear courtyard that had been neglected by the previous two student councils.",
		"  It was a form of legalized torture that could potentially ruin three whole days of your winter break.",
		"  And forget about any compensation in the form of extra credits.",
		"  No, it was pointless volunteer work for a student council project. It was practically a miracle that they had found even a single volunteer.",
		"\"Umm... sorry, but we're clearly... not fit enough... yeah, that's it. That stuff takes conditioning. We'll just eat our canned food in the corner now, okay?\"",
		"\"Yeah, us, too. We're uh... anemic, you see... and if we don't eat this fruit, we'll, uh, die. That, and we already have plans, or something.\"",
		"  All of the students but one scuffled away.",
		"\"That's much better. Lunchtime is best in silence.",
		"  I'm tired of people complaining that you guys make even more noise than the freshmen. Get it together, you losers.\"",
		"  The mob meekly scurried away.",
		"  Soujuurou turned to join them, but as he did...",
		"\"Hold on, Soujuurou. You're with me.\"",
		"  The hand on his shoulder held him in place.",
		"\"Jeez, who does the student council think they are, anyway? Barging into our classroom to lecture us on table manners!\"",
		"  Kinomi cursed him under his breath to his friends the second the vice-president turned to go.",
		"\"What was that, Kinomi? Oh! You wanna become our second volunteer? Perfect! I'll make it the best winter vacation you've ever had!\"",
		"  The vice-president must have heard everything Kinomi said, because he gave a thumbs up before figuratively jabbing it in his eye.",
		"\"Yo, is this guy for real?",
		"  This is voluntary, isn't it? It ain't voluntary if you gotta force people to do it! Am I right?!\"",
		"  The problem child of Class C laughed merrily.",
		"\"That was yesterday.",
		"  The school has since accepted the president's proposal that council members be able to forcibly enlist students for participation.",
		"  And recommendations by the president and vice-president are ironclad. Refusing them means breaking school rules in addition to facing Aozaki's wrath, which, let me tell you now, I won't be able to stop.\"",
		"\"Whaaat!? You're hanging me by my balls here! This is extortion, or blackmail, or something!\"",
		"  Kinomi's terrified shrieking continued behind them as the vice-president and Soujuurou left the classroom.",
		"\"What am I going to do with you, Soujuurou?\"",
		"\"With me? Aren't you busy with other things, vice-president?\"",
		"  The two entered the empty student council room.",
		"  Misaki High's student council had the use of two rooms.",
		"  One was a large office specifically made for the student council.",
		"  The second was an archive room, once used as a preparatory office for math courses.",
		"  As the latter of the two, the walls were lined with densely packed shelves, making an already cramped room seem even more confined.",
		"  For this reason, it served more as a private refuge to the student council.",
		"  The two students sat across from one another.",
		"  Tobimaru Tsukiji.",
		"  He was the son of the chairman of Misaki High School and the vice-president of its school council.",
		"  Like Soujuurou, he was in his second year, and first met the transfer student a week earlier when the task of looking after him was dumped onto the student council.",
		"\"I told you to stop calling me that. People may as well call me the president's dog, the shit I have to take from her.\"",
		"  As self-deprecating as his words were, he hardly seemed dissatisfied with the arrangement.",
		"  He took a snack from his pocket and grimaced at it before taking a bite.",
		"  The hundred-calorie energy bar sacrificed flavor for efficacy, but somehow not enough to prevent him gnawing on it like a piece of jerky.",
		"\"I see what you're saying, Tobimaru, but being a dog isn't exactly a good thing.\"",
		"  Soujuurou sat in the chair with a concerned look on his face.",
		"\"Huh? I didn't catch that. Something about dogs?\"",
		"\"Dogs aren't good. I mean, it's a bad comparison in the first place, but dogs are way scarier.\"",
		"\"Huh? You grew up in the mountains, and you're still afraid of dogs?\"",
		"\"I'm afraid of most animals, but dogs are in a class of their own.",
		"  A pack of wild dogs is particularly terrifying.",
		"  They're as tenacious as they are fast.",
		"  No matter where you run, they'll chase you as long as there's still life left in them.\"",
		"  Soujuurou opened his lunch as he spoke.",
		"  Inside the bright green cloth: three beautifully made triangular rice balls.",
		"\"...Would you look at that.\"",
		"\"Look at what? What do you mean?\"",
		"\"Oh, nothing. It's just that those are some special-looking rice balls you've got there.\"",
		"\"...Is that a good thing or a bad thing?\"",
		"\"I'm trying to compliment you, you idiot.\"",
		"  Soujuurou was always confounded by phrasing that could be interpreted in multiple ways; euphemisms and subtle sarcasm were often lost on him.",
		"  It was only on rare occasions, like this one, that he chose to confirm what was being said.",
		"  Tobimaru had come to suspect that Soujuurou had a very black-and-white way of seeing things.",
		"\"Say, does that hard chunk of flour-looking thing taste any good?\"",
		"  Soujuurou stared at the energy bar with a curious look on his face.",
		"\"It's not meant to taste good. You can try it if you want.",
		"  People shouldn't hold back when it comes to the three base desires.\"",
		"  Tobimaru quickly finished off his bar, put another one on the table, and grabbed one of Soujuurou's rice ball.",
		"  Soujuurou failed to notice the rudeness of the forced exchange, and gave the proffered energy bar a try.",
		"\"...It kind of tastes like dirt.\"",
		"\"Now you get it. It's what a joyless existence tastes like.\"",
		"  Out of principle, Soujuurou labored over his energy bar, cringing all the while.",
		"  He was both curious of the unknown and loathe to leave something unfinished.",
		"\"Don't force yourself to finish it right now. The whole point of it is that you can eat it on the run. And while the flavor isn't that great, at least it's consistent.",
		"  Anyway, never mind that. Are you getting used to how things work around here?\"",
		"\"Yes. You and Aozaki have been a huge help.\"",
		"  Tobimaru turned his eyes up to the ceiling, unable to handle Soujuurou's carefree smile.",
		"  As absentminded as Soujuurou might have been, his expressions were nonetheless incredibly earnest.",
		"  It was like poison to someone as self-absorbed as Tobimaru.",
		"(Now I know why Aozaki goes so out of her way to avoid him.)",
		"  He took a bite from the rice ball to steer himself away from such thoughts.",
		"  Though now cold, the rice had managed to maintain its freshness, startling Tobimaru.",
		"\"...Huh. ",
		"Wait a sec, I'm the one that has your back, you know that right? Aozaki told me you were too annoying to deal with!\"",
		"\"Did I say something to upset you?\"",
		"\"Don't you get it? I'm the only one helping you keep your head above water, while Aozaki sits in the student council room digging up dirt on other students!",
		"  I'm the one who gets lumbered with the crap jobs, while she gets to-\"",
		"  Tobimaru stopped himself, realizing how ridiculous he sounded. Soujuurou, rightly so, knew it was nothing to get this upset over.",
		"\"Well, whatever. I'm only here 'cause she told me to be.",
		"  Do you know?",
		"  Do you know why she lumbered me with you?\"",
		"\"Because you're the vice-president?\"",
		"  Tobimaru's handsome face went dark.",
		"\"Do you really think it's normal for a student council vice-president to waste all of his time on a single transfer student?",
		"  Ugh, whatever, man. Try asking her directly if you get the chance. You'll learn who she really is.\"",
		"  He snatched another bite of the rice ball while grumbling under his breath.",
		"  There it was again. Rice grains that were just dry enough to be fresh and tender in the mouth-a morsel that betrayed its humble description, which must have been delicately molded by a master chef rather than haphazardly clumped into a ball...",
		"\"Just the right amount of salt, and the subtlest of soy sauce notes coming from the center, it...",
		" It doesn't just whet your appetite, it stimulates the desire centers of your brain and-",
		" ...Oh wow.\"",
		"\"Tobimaru, you appear to be thinking out loud.\"",
		"\"It's nothing, just color me surprised.",
		"  Hey, Sono-G, what's this filling, anyway?\"",
		"  It was only natural to inquire about the unexpectedly delicious bite.",
		"  He had been nibbling around the edges and had not yet reached its center.",
		"\"Oh, right. That would be grasshopper.\"",
		"\"No way!\"",
		"  The vice-president choked on his cough.",
		"  He had assumed that Soujuurou would prefer earthy ingredients instead of seafood on account of his mountain life, but he never expected he would use grasshoppers.",
		"\"Damn it! You should have warned me first, Soujuurou! ...But man, was that delicious!\"",
		"\"Oh. I was just joking.\"",
		"  They locked eyes for a moment.",
		"\"It's salmon. I would never eat grasshopper.\"",
		"\"O-Oh, right. Yeah. I knew that.",
		"  Of course it wouldn't be grasshopper.\"",
		"\"Yeah. I mean, you can't find fresh grasshoppers in this city to begin with.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  As curious as those words were, Tobimaru decided to let them go.",
		"\"Jeez, Soujuurou. That's not something to joke about. You want me to hurl or something?\"",
		"\"Don't say bad things about Aozaki then.\"",
		"  Soujuurou closed his eyes as he continued to chew on his rice ball.",
		"  Tobimaru watched incredulously as Soujuurou made no attempt to hide his disapproval.",
		"\"Okay, that I can't let go. You're really saying you were taking revenge for Aozaki?\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou continued chewing.",
		"  The country boy's silent protest said all that needed to be said.",
		"  The vice-president suddenly looked like he had been struck by lightning.",
		"\"What the... Don't tell me you've fallen for Aozaki!",
		"  You have, haven't you? ...Hey! I asked you a question, dammit!\"",
		"  Tobimaru flew out of his chair and violently shook Soujuurou by the shoulders.",
		"  Soujuurou opened his eyes.",
		"\"I forgot. You don't know about what happened a year ago...",
		"  'Cause if you did, you wouldn't be treading down this path of destruction, my friend.\"",
		"\"You've got it all wrong, but that's okay. Tell me what happened a year ago first.\"",
		"\"...Hmph.\"",
		"  Tobimaru regained his composure and sat down after a moment's thought.",
		"\"Okay. I'm not one to gossip, but for you I'm making an exception.\"",
		"  Tobimaru reassured himself that it was in Soujuurou's best interests as a young man to know.",
		"\"It went down when Aozaki was a freshman.",
		"  Everybody was new to high school, so nobody knew what anyone was like yet, her included.",
		"  She was a total babe. I mean just look at her!",
		"  All the guys were crazy for her.\"",
		"  Little did they know that soon after they would go crazy for an entirely different reason.",
		"\"The first couple of months, the school descended into chaos.",
		"  You gotta remember, that early on in the year, no one cared about class hierarchy.",
		"  So tons of guys were fighting themselves over her, it was insane. Just getting anywhere near Aozaki was next to impossible.\"",
		"\"I don't understand. Why would that happen?\"",
		"\"'Cause that's what happens when a hundred guys like the same girl, duh.",
		"  It would have taken Aozaki three months just to have lunch with them all individually.",
		"  So people decided to fight over who got to ask her out.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"\"They were all a bunch of losers if you ask me. But what happened next is the juicy part.\"",
		"\"Those who emerged from the conflict unscathed made their move...",
		"  And though she might not seem like it, she's the type who likes to put a guy down lightly, you know, because of their sincerity or courage or whatever.",
		"  At any rate, she rejected all comers as politely as she could.\"",
		"\"But there was one guy who couldn't take a hint.",
		"  He was a third-year who just refused to give up.",
		"  ...Maybe he was a little bit nuts. It's hard to see it any other way at this point.\"",
		"  Incidentally, Tobimaru decided to gloss over the fact that this student was also the former student council president.",
		"\"But he didn't keep it up only at school. Later he started following her home.",
		" That must have been the last straw, because Aozaki wigged out. She sent him packing in ways I'm not comfortable repeating out loud.\"",
		"\"The conclusion? The student didn't just request a transfer, he tucked tail and left Misaki completely. Aozaki was sentenced to a month of house arrest.",
		"  It came to be known as the Bloody Town Hall Incident.",
		"  She could tell you more about it than I can... but I wouldn't recommend asking her. Ask the school newspaper editor instead. She loves a bit of gossip.\"",
		"\"Tobimaru. I get the feeling you're not telling me everything.\"",
		"\"Hey, you'd do the same if you were me. I may be the board chairman's son and all, but some things scare even me, and I wanna graduate in one piece.",
		"  You want me to freak out every time I see a girl in a school uniform?\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou tilted his head to the side in confusion.",
		"  Tobimaru had lost him with that comment.",
		"\"Well, whatever.",
		"  What is it about Aozaki that you like anyway?\"",
		"  He tilted his head again, this time to the other side.",
		"\"Whoa. Are you really that hot for her?",
		"  'Cause if your heart pounds in her presence, that could be caused by fear, you know. Tell me you aren't stupid enough to like her for no good reason.\"",
		"  He tilted his head even further.",
		"  What Tobimaru was saying sounded off, but Soujuurou decided not to press the matter.",
		"  All the more because he found many of his own emotions towards Aoko Aozaki to be incomprehensible.",
		"\"It is kind of strange, to be honest. I don't even know her that well.\"",
		"  That was because they had not truly spoken to each other since the day she showed him around.",
		"  Every time Soujuurou tried to talk to her, she immediately got up and left.",
		"  As fate would have it, they ended up working together that recent Sunday, but made only idle chatter on the way and back.",
		"\"There's something you don't know, either, Tobimaru.",
		"  Sometimes I feel someone's gaze on me, and when I turn around to see who it is, she's there, looking like she's worried about me, that I'll mess up.",
		"  I know what you'll say-she just happened to see me in the hallway and was keeping an eye on me. Maybe she secretly wishes she could ignore me when we pass each other.",
		"  But whatever the reason, I believe her concern is genuine.\"",
		"\"And that's the most important thing about all this.",
		"  I believe that nature of hers has helped me out repeatedly.\"",
		"  His tone was measured and sincere.",
		"  Tobimaru sighed with a tinge of regret.",
		"  If not for those words, he could have introduced Soujuurou to a more suitable girl with whom he could have lived out the rest of his school days in peace.",
		"  He never went to such lengths for his other friends.",
		"  Generally speaking, if it was of some benefit to him, he was unafraid of exploiting another.",
		"  If they were of no use, he didn't bother getting involved with them. That was how Tobimaru Tsukiji operated.",
		"  Soujuurou happened to be the type of person who provided no benefit to Tobimaru, yet somehow sparked in him a desire to help.",
		"  It was not that friendship was completely alien to him.",
		"  He just did not have many people he felt that close to.",
		"  So if Soujuurou had really fallen for Aoko, it was not his place, as a friend, to try to change his mind.",
		"\"Ugh, well, I guess it's true that love knows no reason.\"",
		"\"I wouldn't say there's no reason for it. I can think of one at least.",
		"  I thought she was beautiful the moment I first laid eyes on her.\"",
		"\"Uh.\"",
		"  Tobimaru's shoulders slumped.",
		"\"After all that, you just like her for her looks? Listen to yourself, Soujuurou!\"",
		"\"What's wrong with appreciating beauty?",
		"  I don't think there is anything wrong with judging someone by the physical appearance they worked hard to create.\"",
		"\"Err...\"",
		"  That sounded like a sophism to Tobimaru, but he had no counterpoint to offer.",
		"\"All right. I get it. I'll let it go. It's none of my business who you go after anyway.\"",
		"  Now...",
		"  About the one major thing that Tobimaru had been mistaken about this whole conversation.",
		"  Namely, that Soujuurou was not head-over-heels in love with Aoko and hoped to go steady with her. He merely liked her as a person.",
		"  Nobody could have foreseen the massive calamity that would be caused by this simple misunderstanding.",
		"\"I've just got one piece of advice for you, Soujuurou.",
		"Just because Aozaki fights with someone doesn't mean she hates them, and just because she's nice to someone doesn't mean she likes them.",
		" I'm a prime example of that.\"",
		"  He spoke with a pained sigh as if opening old wounds from the past.",
		"\"I see.",
		" What happened?\"",
		"\"Long story short, she used to be really full of herself, and I once tried to hit her.",
		"  It happened last summer. I'd already been working with her in the student council for a year at that point and saw her more like a fellow soldier in the trenches than as a girl.",
		"  One day, I lost my temper and I took a swing at her. I like to think I've got a mean right hook, and I slugged her pretty good, so I thought I won that round.",
		"  He had a distant look in his eyes as his words trailed off.",
		"\"The next day, when I came to the student council room, I thought she'd be spoiling for a fight, but she was the same as always.",
		"  And since then, we've simply continued working together as president and vice-president.\"",
		"  Soujuurou sighed at his story.",
		"  He then said, with absolute confidence,",
		"\"So, you just wanted to brag about how close you two are?\"",
		"  Clearly, he had missed the point entirely.",
		"\"Are you kidding me!?",
		" How in the hell do you come to that conclusion after hearing a story like that!?",
		" ",
		"I'm telling you that from that day forward I could never see her again as a woman!\"",
		"\"Oh, I was mistaken?\"",
		"  A look of disappointment flittered across Soujuurou's face. ",
		"  Tobimaru revised his opinion of him. Soujuurou was something of a simpleton, but there was something more about him that Tobimaru could not quite place.",
		"\"Just take it from me-her standards are anything but normal.",
		"  She won't like you for being nice to her, and she won't hate you for being mean to her. That's the kind of princess she is.\"",
		"  Soujuurou answered that he would keep it in mind, as he looked to the clock.",
		"  They had been talking for a while, and lunch was almost over.",
		"\"Is there anything else you wanted to discuss?\"",
		"\"Huh? I didn't have anything to discuss in the first place.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Why had Tobimaru even brought him here in the first place? Soujuurou tilted his head in wonder but shook it off to deal with the more pressing matters at hand.",
		"\"Could you stay a little longer?",
		"  There's something I wanted to ask you.\"",
		"\"Yes?\"",
		"  Tobimaru sat up straight, having never seen Soujuurou's face look so serious before.",
		"  Soujuurou set aside his rice ball and cleared his throat.",
		"\"It's about something that happened yesterday.\"",
		"  He spoke solemnly.",
		"  And as carefully as possible, he recounted what had occurred the night before..."
