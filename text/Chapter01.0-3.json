		"　彼女が正門についた頃、雨脚は弱くなっていた。",
		"　遠くの空には日射しが見え隠れしている。",
		"　この分なら、雨は昼過ぎにあがっているかもしれない。",
		"「……といっても、私には関係のない話だけど」",
		"　空模様とは裏腹に、彼女の運勢はボロボロだ。",
		"　徹夜明けの朝に起こされたうえ、冬の雨に見舞われた。",
		"　この分では、用件とやらもロクな事じゃない―――",
		"　そんな予感に頭痛を覚えながら、彼女は正門を抜けて校舎に向かう。",
		"　途中、すれ違った生徒はひとりもいない。",
		"　部活中の生徒も見あたらない。",
		"　職員用の玄関の受付には“休憩中”の立て看板。",
		"　学校は生徒に平等な休日を与えていた。",
		"　もちろん、こんな時間に呼び出された彼女を除いて。",
		"　そんな事実がますます感情を<逆撫|さかな>でする。",
		"　彼女が職員室の扉を開けると、見慣れた教師が机に向かっていた。",
		"　地味だがパリッとしたシャツと背広、",
		"　穏やかではあるが油断ならない細眼鏡。",
		"　似合わない煙草をふかしている、二十代中盤の優男。",
		"　どうにも、まだ彼女に気付いていない様子だ。",
		"「<山城|やましろ>先生」",
		"　勢いよく扉を閉める。",
		"　その音にさして驚いた様子もなく、山城と呼ばれた教師は顔を上げた。",
		"「やあ、おはよう<蒼崎|あおざき>くん。用件は聞いているかな？」",
		"「はい。一時間前に自宅で。事前に何の相談もなく」",
		"　この高校の卒業生である<山城|かれ>は、生徒たちとそう歳が離れていない。",
		"　そのせいか他の教師より生徒に<慕|した>われている。",
		"　話題も<豊富|ほうふ>で口調も<穏和|おんわ>。",
		"　教師というより頼れる先輩といった人物だが、あいにく、彼女はそう慕ってもいなかった。",
		"　教師は<冷徹|れいてつ>であるべきである。",
		"　生徒にとっては愛憎いり交じった険しい壁であり、間違っても<憩|いこ>いの場でニコニコ笑っているお兄さん……であってはならない、というのが彼女の持論だ。",
		"　山城教諭は彼女が良しとする教師像とは正反対の人物で、自然、彼への口調は堅く、愛想のないものになる。",
		"　……もっとも。愛想なんて微笑ましいもの、彼女には初めから装備されてはいないのだが。",
		"「はあ。今日もご機嫌ななめみたいだね、君は」",
		"「それは先生の気のせいです。",
		"　今日だけ特別、という話ではありませんから」",
		"　きっぱりと返答しつつも、彼女自身、自分がひどい顔をしているのは承知していた。",
		"　寝起きの機嫌の悪さと寝不足の疲れがあいまって、<仇|かたき>を見るような目つきになっているだろう。",
		"「そう。ならいいんだけどね、彼にはそう辛く当たらないでくれよ。僕らじゃ正直、どう扱っていいか分からないところもあるし」",
		"「先生。その件ですけど、私、まだ詳しい話を聞かされていないのですが」",
		"　刺すような彼女の視線と声に、山城教諭はああ、と応えて煙草の火をもみ消した。",
		"「んー、電話じゃなんて聞いたの？」",
		"「転入生の紹介をする、とだけです。",
		"　理由も<脈絡|みゃくらく>も無い説明でした」",
		"　簡潔な答えに、山城は感心して眉を上げた。",
		"　彼女が怒っているのは見てとれたが、その理由が休日に呼び出された件ではなく、電話の内容が<要領|ようりょう>を得なかったからだとは。",
		"　いやはや実に<厳格|げんかく>だ、と山城教諭は苦笑した。",
		"「先生。これが笑い話なら、そろそろ帰っていいでしょうか？」",
		"「いや、ごめんごめん、謝るよ。冗談じゃなくて真面目な話なんだ。ちょっと、君の手を借りたくてね」",
		"「本当に、転入生の問題で？」",
		"「うん、訳ありというか、難しいというか。",
		"　彼……<草十郎|そうじゅうろう>くんというんだけど、ちょっと、色々とズレていてね。僕らが案内してあげるより、同世代の君の方が適任だと思ったんだ」",
		"「…………」",
		"　彼女は不審げに表情を<曇|くも>らせた。",
		"　教師の業務を生徒に押しつけるのも<怠慢|たいまん>だが、それ以上にその転入生が『ズレている』とはどういう事だろう？",
		"　素行に問題がある、扱いが難しい、というのなら想像しやすい。",
		"しかし、ズレている、というのは何なのか。",
		"『ズレてるなんて、そう使わない表現だけど……』",
		"　彼女は不審げに思案するも、すぐに頭を切りかえた。",
		"　あれこれ悩んでも仕方がない。",
		"　なんだかこの会話自体がズレているようで居心地が悪いし、情報が少なすぎるし、そもそも、断るつもりなら今頃ベッドの上でうろんな貝の気分になっている。",
		"「ひとつ、質問があります」",
		"「なに？　あ、学年は君と同じ二年生だよ。性格は落ち着きがあって、人の話をよく聞くタイプ。裏を返せば覇気がないともとれるけど、それならそれで付き合いやすいだろ？",
		"　蒼崎くんとはクラスは違うけど、きっと仲良くな―――」",
		"「そういった事は本人から直接<訊|き>きますし、<量|はか>ります。",
		"　そうではなく、なぜ私なんでしょうか」",
		"　<刺々|とげとげ>しい<質|こ><問|え>は、同時に転入生の案内を承諾していた。",
		"　不満ではあるが、とりあえず自分の感情は置いて、与えられた役目に取り組んでみる。",
		"　<極|きわ>めて自己中心的な気質でありながら、<努|つと>めて公正でいようとするのが彼女の特長だ。",
		"　やや<倒錯|とうさく>しているが、その芯の強さを山城などは頼もしく思ってしまう。",
		"　……まあ。",
		"　時折、その強さが予想の<範疇|はんちゅう>を超える事もあるが、それはそれ、天災と思って<諦|あきら>めるのが、ここ一年で山城教諭が学んだ彼女への対応策である。",
		"「もう一度だけ訊きます、山城先生。",
		"　それで、なぜ私なんでしょうか？」",
		"　有無を言わせぬ<詰問|きつもん>に、山城教諭はやや押されながらも返答する。",
		"「うん、それはね。",
		"　別に、蒼崎くんが先生方に<敬遠|けいえん>されているのと同じぐらい信頼されていて、学校のためなら教師も生徒も一緒くたに斬って捨てる鉄の生徒会長、だからじゃないよ」",
		"「……それ以外に、こんな呼びつけを受ける理由はないと思いますけど」",
		"　信用ならない、と彼女は半眼で生徒会顧問を見据えた。",
		"　十七才の少女にあるまじき迫力と、",
		"　十七才の少女らしい愛らしさ。",
		"　奇跡的なバランスで両立する眼差しを、山城教諭は見惚れるように、穏やかな笑顔で受けとめる。",
		"「いや、責務だけでいいなら僕がやってるさ。この人選に関しちゃ教師や生徒会長といった役職も関係ないよ。",
		"　なんていうか、こんな頼みを<損得|そんとく>抜きで聞いてくれるのは君だけだと思ってね。適任ですから、と強く推薦したわけ」",
		"　要は、“なんだかんだ言って底抜けに人がいいでしょ君”と言われているようなものだ。",
		"「―――山城先生」",
		"「うわ怖っ。もう、<睨|にら>まない睨まない。言ったろ、僕にはともかく彼には笑顔でって。",
		"　とまあ、納得してくれたなら、すぐに移動しよう。もうずいぶん待たせてしまっているからね。",
		"　それと、雨の中ご苦労さま。帰りはもちろん車で送るよ」",
		"　スマートに立ち上がる山城教諭。",
		"　それにけっこうです、とだけ返して、彼女は職員室を後にした。",
		"　待ち続けること一時間。",
		"　いつのまにか、空模様は小雨になっていた。",
		"　彼はぼんやりと、雨だれの音を聴いている。",
		"　長方形の机が事務的に置かれただけの部屋。",
		"　人影は一つ。彼の他には誰もいない。",
		"　この部屋に通され、座って待っているように言われてから、もうずいぶんと時間が経っている。",
		"　まっとうな学生なら不満や不安をクチにしてもいい頃だろうに、少年はそれこそ畑のカカシのように、じっと言いつけを守っていた。",
		"　体の<芯|しん>にまで届く寒さ。",
		"　十一月の終わり、冬を迎え始めた午前の気温である。",
		"　室温は外より幾らかましな程度。",
		"　ストーブをつけていいから、という教師の声を聞き逃したのか、このタイプのストーブはまだ見た事がなかったのか、暖房は入っていない。",
		"　彼は冷たくなってきた指先に軽く息をあてながら、ぼんやりと周囲を観察する。",
		"　この殺風景な部屋は会議室と言うらしい。",
		"　在校生から見れば<仰々|ぎょうぎょう>しい会議室だが、彼から見れば飾り気のない、広いだけの部屋だった。",
		"　生活の匂いがしないため、つい、乾ききった<岩屋|いわや>などを連想してしまう。",
		"　彼はやる事もないので、こんな冷たい場所でどんな話し合いをするのだろう、と真剣に検討してみた。",
		"「…………………………",
		"、むう」",
		"　どう考えても答えはでそうにないので、<雨音|あまおと>に意識を戻す。",
		"　雨の空は、山のものと少しだけ似ている。",
		"　いや、かろうじて原形を留めている。",
		"　匂いも音も<硬|かた>くなっているが、根底は同じモノだ。",
		"　こんな異界にあっても山と共通する物がある―――",
		"　そんな<些細|ささい>な事がしんみりと嬉しい。",
		"　雨に濡れた町は好きだ。",
		"　よく晴れた晴天の方が心地よいのは当然だが、そういう気持ち良さとは別の視点で、彼は雨空を好いている。",
		"　雨に<煙|けぶ>った町並みは少しだけ土の匂いが増して、未練がましくも故郷を<想|おも>ってしまう。",
		"　そんな時だけ、都会にやってきた不安も少しは薄れていく気がするからだ。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　……と、すぐに<落胆|らくたん>の息がこぼれた。",
		"　まったく情けない。",
		"引っ越して二週間も経つのに、気を抜くと故郷を<偲|しの>ぶ未練がましさに肩を落とす。",
		"　これではせっかくの新生活に申し訳がないではないか、と彼はひとり気合いを入れ直して、行儀良く待ち続けることにした。",
		"　ぼんやりと熱心に、雨の音に意識を向ける。",
		"　彼にとって、この程度の待ちぼうけは苦でもないらしい。",
		"　痺れるような寒さも、一時間の放置も、深呼吸と一緒にあっさり飲み下す平常心。",
		"　岩の上にも三年とか、耐え続けた<赤穂浪士|あこうろうし>とか。",
		"　長所かどうかはさておいて、呆れるほどの辛抱強さ。",
		"　それが現時点における、この少年の特長だった。",
		"　一方、彼女はいたくご<立腹|りっぷく>だった。",
		"　職員室から会議室に向かうまでの間、これから会う人物のプロフィールを聞いたからだ。",
		"　なんでも、その人物は生まれてから今の今まで、電気も<通|かよ>っていない山奥で暮らしていたらしい。",
		"　電気がないという事は、現在の文明社会の半分以上を知らない事になる。",
		"『なんて絶望的な断絶、戦後どころか戦前の話じゃない。",
		"　ロビンソンにも程がある……！』",
		"　彼女のそんな<憤|いきどお>りもやむをえまい。",
		"　なんでも、その山奥の村は長いこと集落として孤立していたらしい。",
		"　<麓|ふもと>の村とですら月に一度の郵便で連絡をとるだけなんて、現代日本とは思えない。",
		"　が、しかし。今や高速道路やＪＲ……旧国鉄……といった動脈静脈が張り巡らされた我が国ではあるが、そういった山村は無いと言い切れないのも事実である。",
		"　いま確かなコトは、そんな状況で暮らしてきた人間が何を考えて生きているか想像できない、というコトだけだ。",
		"「電気がないって……村に行き渡っていないだけで、公衆電話ぐらいはあったんですよね？」",
		"「なかったそうだよ。こっちに暮らすようになって、まず驚いたのが電話だそうだし。",
		"　電話って便利ですね、なんて真顔で言われてねぇ。そういえばそうだなあ、と再確認させられたぐらいだよ」",
		"　あはは、と笑う教師を彼女は横目で睨む。",
		"　何が嬉しいのか、山城教諭は田舎の純朴な少年にあてられて<和|なご>んでいるらしい。",
		"「……<駐在|ちゅうざい>もいないって事か……うちも実家は山奥ですから、電気が通っていないのはあり得ないとは言いませんけど。",
		"　―――そいつ、学校<も|・>知らないんですか？」",
		"「うん。どんなものかは知っていたそうだけど、実際来るのは今日が初めてらしい。それで緊張していたのかな、あまり会話も<弾|はず>まなかった。",
		"　うーん、ああいうのも野生児っていうのかな？　狼に育てられた狼少年、みたいな？　いや、探検隊の話だねぇ！」",
		"「…………………」",
		"「ちょっ、怖いなあ蒼崎くん。冗談、冗談だって。そう睨まないでくれ。",
		"　大丈夫、話してみた感じ、おとなしい子だったから！",
		"　なんていうか、言葉の通じない小動物みたいな感じ」",
		"「山城先生。その<喩|たと>え、気休めになってませんから」",
		"　つっけんどんに返しつつ、彼女は電気のない生活とやらをシミュレートしようとし、ただでさえ不機嫌な顔をいっそう刺々しく曇らせた。",
		"　だって、それは彼女の知らない世界だ。",
		"　教師陣が両手を上げて降参したのも頷ける。",
		"　本当は彼女も降参して暖かなベッドに戻りたかったが、<一|いち><文|もん>にもならない自尊心が押しとどめていた。",
		"　出来ると見込まれ、自分も出来ると判断して引き受けた以上、経緯や内容はどうあれ、そう簡単に放り出すワケにはいかないのだ。",
		"　<雨音|あまおと>を背に、冷めきった廊下を歩いていく。",
		"　会議室はもう目前。",
		"　眉間に<皺|しわ>をよせたまま、長い髪を揺らして、彼女はまだ見ぬ異邦人へと向かっていく。",
		"　優雅な足取りのまま、戦場に突撃するかの如く。",
		"「……いや、蒼崎くん？",
		"　君を信頼してる僕だけど、念のため確認しておくよ。なんていうか、優しくね。できれば笑顔とか作れないかな？」",
		"「作り笑いは苦手です。一応、努力しているつもりですが」",
		"「あ。そうなんだ、それは良かった。",
		"　……いやあ、ほんと良かった。蒼崎くんにも苦手なものってあったんだねぇ……」",
		"　山城教諭が肩を落とすのと、<件|くだん>の会議室に到着したのは同時だった。",
		"　山城教諭は“優しく、優しくね”と目配せし、会議室の扉に手をかける。",
		"　そんな扱いに、彼女のイライラは増すばかりだ。",
		"『……分かってるわよ、愛想が悪いってのは。でも笑顔なんて意識して作るものじゃないんだし……",
		"だいたい、そういうインスタントな人付き合いなら<鳶丸|とびまる>の方が向いてるっての』",
		"　彼女は自分の愛想の無さにため息をつくが、考えてみると、寝不足のまま休日の学校に呼び出されては笑顔も何もあったものではない。",
		"　くわえて、その元凶は高校生より小学生から始めた方がよさそうな人物なのだ。",
		"　……その人物に責任はないにせよ、彼女にだって、学校側の仕事を押しつけられる責任も義理もないのである。",
		"　せめて、なんというか。",
		"　もうちょっと空気を読んで平日にやってきてくれたのなら、と愚痴の一つも言いたくなる。",
		"『……いや。というか敵。何であろうと敵。",
		"　悪いけど<情状酌量|じょうじょうしゃくりょう>以前に敵……！",
		"　間が悪いのはお互い様っていうか、ほんと、なんでよりにもよってこんな忙しい時に―――』",
		"　寝不足でキリキリ痛む頭が、彼女の攻撃性を一割増しにする。",
		"　この扉の向こうにいる人物がどれだけ無害であれ、我が眠りを妨げたモノはみんな敵。",
		"　そんな彼女のイライラが頂点に達しかけたタイミングで、山城教諭は会議室の扉を開けた。",
		"　……ゆっくりと横に開いていく風景。",
		"　<情緒|じょうちょ>なんてお構いなし。",
		"　まっすぐな視線のまま、彼女は会議室に<突撃|しんこう>し―――",
		"　その、一風変わった敵と対面した。",
		"　カメラは再び一方に。",
		"　時間は、少しだけ巻き戻る。",
		"『何をしなくともいい』という指令は、",
		"　ある種の人間にとってはかけがえのない贅沢であり、",
		"　ある種の人間にとっては耐えがたい責め苦である。",
		"　能動的な彼女にすれば<羨|うらや>ましい反面、怪しすぎて受け取れない高級品。",
		"　受動的な彼にすれば親しめる反面、郷愁を起こす<苦|にが>い棘……の筈なのだが、目下、絶賛待たされっぱなしの顔にこれといった不満は見られない。",
		"　彼は自然に、姿勢を正したまま灰色の空模様を眺めている。",
		"　さらに待ち続けてはや一時間だが、まあ、先方さんにも都合があるのだろうし、何もお金を取られるワケでもなし。",
		"　雨音さえあればいつまでも待ち続けられる、といった風。",
		"『でも、そろそろ九時を過ぎるのか……",
		"　うん、どうなんだろう』",
		"　それでも漠然と、いちおう時計を気にしながら、ぼんやりと雨音を聴く。",
		"　休日の校舎に<雑音|かいわ>はない。",
		"　ポツポツと窓を叩く雨。",
		"　しん……と沈みこむ空気の<軋|きし>み。",
		"　それと、",
		"　カツカツとまっすぐに、<力|ちから>強く響いてくる<靴|くつ>の音。",
		"『……良かった、忘れられているかと思った』",
		"　軽い足音と、それより重い大人の足音が聞こえる。",
		"　彼がほっと安堵の息をもらした時、会議室の扉がスライドした。",
		"「すまないね、ずいぶんとお待たせしちゃって」",
		"　まず目に入ったのが、バツの悪そうな笑顔をした、眼鏡をかけた男性。",
		"　たしか<山城和樹|やましろかずき>という先生で、ここに案内してくれたのも彼だった。",
		"「って、あれ？　<里中|さとなか>先生いないんですか？",
		"　……酷いなあ、話し相手になってあげてと言ったのに」",
		"　山城氏はますます申し訳なさそうに頭をかく。",
		"　その後ろから、",
		"　不機嫌そうに口を閉ざしたまま。",
		"　迷いのない眼差しで、長い黒髪の少女が現れた。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　呆然と息を<呑|の>む。",
		"　窓を打つ雨音が<聴覚|せかい>から消失する。",
		"　……この時。",
		"　錯覚ではあれ、時間の経過を感じなくなる事は本当にあるのだと、彼ははじめて思い知った。",
		"「………………」",
		"　彼女はほんの少し、驚くように<瞬|またた>いた。",
		"　理由は不明。",
		"　先だって聞いていた通り、少年は純朴な田舎のイメージそのものだったのに、直感的に“納得いかない”と反発して。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　彼はほんの少し、驚くように目を開いた。",
		"　理由は明白。",
		"　……ただ、それを正しくカタチにできる言葉を知らなかったので、結局こちらも解答欄は空白のまま。",
		"　この瞬間。",
		"　少年はたしかに、何か運命じみたものに触れた気がした。",
		"「紹介するよ。彼が転入生の<静希|しずき><草十郎|そうじゅうろう>くん。",
		"　で、こっちの彼女が静希くんの案内役。",
		"　うちの生徒会長で、休日を押して新しい仲間の案内役を買って出てくれた、<蒼崎|あおざき><青子|あおこ>くんだ」",
		"　―――声も雨音も<仄|ほの>かに遠く。",
		"　二人の出会いはこんな感じ。",
		"　良きにしろ<悪|わる>きにしろ、バチッと火花が散るような、そんな、どうでもいい始まりだった。",
		"　生徒たちの通説によると。",
		"　蒼崎青子は、いつもご機嫌ななめである。",
		"　これは九割がた偏見で、青子だって、そんな四六時中イライラできるほど暇ではない。",
		"　彼女は単に言い訳をしたがらない性格なだけで、",
		"　たえず微妙に、ときに露骨に、見えない何かに対して怒っているように見えるだけなのだ。",
		"　なので九割がたは偏見の、噂に尾ひれのついた学園七脅威の一つにすぎない。",
		"　ただし、残りの一割は真実だ。",
		"　青子自身、自分が慢性的な頭痛持ちなんじゃないかと疑うほど、無害なものに反感を覚える事があったりする。",
		"　今日はその一割の話。",
		"　そういう時にかぎって彼女の怒りは純真な、",
		"　年相応に子供らしいわがままだったりするのだが。",
		"　会議室は薄暗い、雨の色に染まっていた。",
		"　電気代節約のため、昼間は電灯をつけないのが学校のルールだ。",
		"　そんな中に、<件|くだん>の人物は立っていた。",
		"　第一印象は、野花を連想させる落ち着き様。",
		"　すっと伸びた背筋のクセに、全体的に力が抜けていて、とにかくおとなしい。",
		"　ひょろり、とはいかないまでも、ひっそり、ぐらいの<頼|たよ>りなさ。",
		"　制服の上からでも分かる、標準よりやや細い体つき。",
		"　あまり手入れをされていない黒髪と、とくに目を引く部分のない少年像が、そこにはあった。",
		"　いや。その<凡庸|ぼんよう>さを好意的に解釈するなら、少年ではなく青年っぽいというべきだろう。",
		"　落ち着いた雰囲気がどことなく大人びている。",
		"　……そのあたりが青子の“理由なき反感”に繋がったのか。",
		"　少年はあまりに自然で、違和感なく会議室の風景に溶けこんでいた。学校では彼の方が異分子なのに、自分たちの方が客人になったような錯覚。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　まるで、自分たちが持って生まれた正当性を<糾|ただ>されたような、正体不明の苛立ち。",
		"　カチン、と警戒心にスイッチが入るのを青子は感じた。",
		"『―――信じられない。",
		"　私、いま<意|ワ><味|ケ>もなく怒ってない……？』",
		"　分からない事は苛立たしい。自分の<感|コ><情|ト>なら尚更だ。",
		"　完璧主義者である彼女にとって、それは痛くはないけど気がかりなトゲのようなもので、",
		"「いやぁ、ははは。ほら蒼崎くん、挨拶してあげなくちゃ」",
		"　山城の場を取り<繕|つくろ>う声にも、わりと本気でイラっとした。",
		"「―――挨拶？」",
		"　じろりと山城を横目で睨んでから、青子はまっすぐに少年を見据えた。",
		"　いや、第三者的に見れば、正面から睨みつけた。",
		"　この瞬間。",
		"　災難なことに、彼女の感情の矛先はぴったりと、なんの罪もない初対面の少年に向けられたのである。",
		"「いや、待たせたね静希くん」",
		"　名前を呼ばれて少年……草十郎は我に返った。",
		"　見惚れていた目をゆるめて、",
		"　目眩を飲みこむように息を吸う。",
		"　その仕草から緊張していると見たのか、山城教諭は穏やかに笑って、かたわらの少女に語りかけた。",
		"「紹介するよ。彼が転入生の静希草十郎くん。",
		"　で、こっちの彼女が静希くんの案内役。うちの生徒会長で、休日を押して新しい仲間の案内役を買って出てくれた、蒼崎青子くんだ」",
		"　山城教諭に紹介され、少女は一歩前に出る。",
		"　視線に容赦はない。",
		"　ほとんど暴力に近い、<値|ね><踏|ぶ>みするような凝視。",
		"　<一方|いっぽう>草十郎は、正面から堂々と見つめられる事に驚きつつ、なんとか平静を保っていた。",
		"　これまでこういう挨拶には出会わなかったけれど、都会では珍しいものではないのだろう、と勘違いしての事である。",
		"　そんなふたりのやり取りは、第三者視点からすると壮絶なものがあった。",
		"　とにかく因縁をつけたがっている乱暴者と、",
		"　それを何事だろう、と真剣に眺めている田舎者。",
		"　当事者たちはともかく、周りにいる人間にとっては蛇の生殺しに近い。",
		"　たとえば、青子の後ろにいる山城教諭とか。",
		"　良かれと思って案内役に優等生を選んでみたものの、なぜかその優等生はご機嫌ななめ。今もピリピリと空気を<震|ふる>わせている。",
		"　ここに至って、山城は自らの失敗を受け入れた。",
		"　今さらの話ではあるが、",
		"　この、万事をそつなく解決する女子生徒は、扱いどころを間違えると一転して学校を<震|ふる>わす嵐になる。",
		"　オールマイティの絵柄が<悪魔|ジョーカー>みたいなもので、そんな時、現場に居合わせた教師はたいてい、<不祥事|ふしょうじ>の責任を取らされるのだ。",
		"「あー、うん。いけてる、二人とも気は合うようだね！",
		"　……それじゃ、僕はこのヘンでいいかな？」",
		"　あはは、と白けた笑い声をあげながら、山城教諭はそろりそろりと扉に後じさった。",
		"「僕は職員室にいるから、終わったら来るように。",
		"　いいかい蒼崎くん、くれぐれも、くれぐれもだぜ？",
		"　なんていうか、生徒会長としての度量の広さを、このさい僕に信じさせてほしいかな！」",
		"　見つめあう……正確に言うと、一方は睨まれている…ふたりをそれきりにして、山城教諭は去っていった。",
		"　残されたのは<木訥|ぼくとつ>さの化身みたいな少年と、",
		"　ずーんと腕組みをしている少女だけ。",
		"　しばしの沈黙。",
		"　お互い初手に悩んでいる将棋指しのようだが、その実、思案しているのは自分だけである事に青子は気付いた。",
		"　とりあえず、<苛々|イライラ>するのは置いておいて。",
		"　そもそも彼に反感を覚える理由はないんだから、と大きくため息をついて、青子は草十郎に向き直った。",
		"「まあいいわ。山城先生が<昼行灯|ひるあんどん>なのは今に始まった事じゃないし。",
		"―――それで。あなた、名前は？」",
		"　きつい口調は、自分から話しかけてこない少年を非難してのものだ。",
		"が、少年は声に含まれた嫌味に気が付かなかった。",
		"　そういう毒っ気とは一生<縁|えん>のない顔で、",
		"「ああ、静希草十郎かな。君は蒼崎さんだったね」",
		"　なぜか嬉しげに、噛みしめるように応答した。",
		"「さんはいいわ、<柄|ガラ>じゃないから。",
		"　こっちは静希君でいい？」",
		"「いいって、なにが？」",
		"「だから呼び方。<君|くん>付けでいいかって訊いてるの」",
		"「――――――」",
		"「……なによ。おかしなコト言った、私？」",
		"「いや、すごく」",
		"　少年は当たり前のように即答しながら、あれ、そうでもないのか、などとひとりこぼす。",
		"「いや、いいんだ、ごく一般的なんだろう。",
		"　静希君で頼む。君は蒼崎でいいんだよな？」",
		"「ええ、よろしく」",
		"　素っ気なく応えて<踵|きびす>を返す青子。",
		"　気は乗らないが、任されたからにはきちんと仕事をこなすのが彼女のポリシーである。",
		"「悪いけど、優しくしてあげる気はないから。",
		"　時間も惜しいし、手早くいくわよ」",
		"「それは助かる。やっぱり時間は大切だ」",
		"　青子の<直球|いやみ>は、またも効果なくスルーされた。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　どんな行為にしろ、無視をされると余計意識してしまうのが人間である。",
		"　さっきからことごとく攻撃が<空|から>ぶっている事にムッとしながらも、青子は<努|つと>めて事務的に廊下に出るよう<促|うなが>した。",
		"　窓のない通路には外からの日差しも、人の気配もない。",
		"　会議室が天然の岩屋なら、こちらは人工の監獄を思わせる。",
		"　実に今の気分にあった廊下だわ、と青子はまたもため息ひとつ。",
		"「まず訊いておくけど、山城先生から聞いた事は理解してる？」",
		"「ああ、学校の仕組みについては分かった。",
		"　この建物ぜんぶに<同|おな>い<年|どし>の人間がいるなんて、ちょっと想像できないけど」",
		"「……そ、良かったわね」",
		"　額を指で押さえる青子。",
		"　この草十郎という少年は学校のなんたるかも知らなかった。",
		"ただ漠然と、大勢の人々で学習する場所、としか聞いていなかったらしい。",
		"　高校教師は様々な分野の知識や見識、<機構|きこう>と創造性を生徒に教授する。",
		"　が、そもそも学校とは何か、と根本の理念を語る日がこようとは、夢にも思わなかっただろう。",
		"　基本は大事というが、それにしても基本すぎる。",
		"　……そんなんで高等学校の授業についてこられるのかと青子は疑問を抱いたが、山城教諭曰く、そこは何とかなっていたとのこと。",
		"　一応、転入試験はギリギリでパスしたらしい。",
		"『……ま、私には関係ないけど』",
		"　内心で呟きながら廊下を歩く青子。",
		"　なんであれ、この<時代錯誤|じだいさくご>な男子と付き合うのは今日だけなのだ、いや、今日だけにしたい、と自分に言い聞かせながら。",
		"「蒼崎」",
		"　そんな青子に、少年は平然と話しかけた。",
		"「なに？」",
		"「こっちもひとつ訊いていいかな」",
		"「だから、なに？」",
		"「俺の気のせいだと思うんだが、君はまるで、何かを睨んでいるように見える。",
		"　やはり、今朝は悪いものでも？」",
		"　食べたのかい？　と本気で心配する眼差し。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　ガン、と二度目のハンマーが青子の頭を叩いた。",
		"　たしかに青子はさっきから草十郎を睨んでいる。",
		"　というかもう本気で睨んでいる。",
		"　むしろあらゆるものを睨んでいる。",
		"　平時でさえ同居人から、",
		"『青子の視線は普通の人には厳しいわ。",
		"　もう少し、多くのことに寛大になるべきね』",
		"　と<諭|さと>されるぐらいの視線が、明確に“これ以上負荷がかかったらキレる”と意思表示しまくっているのだ。それを気のせいと感じられるほど、この少年は鈍感なのだろうか？",
		"『……私を馬鹿にしてる……って訳じゃなさそうよね、この場合』",
		"「？」",
		"　自分にそう言い聞かせてみたが、あまり確証は取れそうになかった。",
		"　青子は今さらながら直感する。",
		"　この間の抜けた転入生は、自分にとって未知の生き物と同義なのではないだろうか、と。",
		"「……いいわ。言葉にしないと分からないようだから言うけど、まるで、じゃなくて、ずばりそうなの。",
		"　貴方の気のせいじゃなくて、私は視線で遠回しに感情を表現してたの。いちいち声にだすのも、会話にするのも面倒だから」",
		"　青子の言葉に、ポン、と両手を叩くインベーダー。",
		"「なるほど。どうしてそうしたいのかは分からないが、たしかに、そっちの方がてっとり早い意思表現だ」",
		"　素直に納得する草十郎。",
		"　けれど、彼は青子がどんな感情を表現しているのかが分かっていない。",
		"　文字は読めるけれど、その意味までは掴めていない。",
		"　本来直結して考えるべき事が、ブロック単位で離れている感じ。",
		"『……たしかにズレてるわ、こいつ……』",
		"　青子は山城教諭の言葉を今更ながらに納得した。",
		"　この少年のおかしさは、鈍感だとかそういった基準の話ではないらしい。",
		"　……それでも。彼にとってここは異国の地のようなもの、多少の時差ボケは許容するのが文明人というものだろう。",
		"「じゃ、とりあえず貴方の教室に行くから」",
		"　気を取り直して青子は言う。",
		"　それを草十郎は片手を上げて止めた。",
		"「ああ、あとひとつ」",
		"　あくまで泰然と言う草十郎に、青子は黙って先を<促|うなが>した。",
		"　額を指で押さえたまま、漠然とした不安を感じたまま。",
		"「これもちょっとした疑問なんだが、なんで君は怒ってるんだ？",
		"　怒るのが商売とか、そういう家柄の人なのか？」",
		"「―――――――――」",
		"　長い沈黙。",
		"　今となっては後の祭りだが、青子はしばし、今朝の電話を取った事を痛烈に後悔した。",
		"　相手に悪気はない。",
		"　これは天然、ただの天然、と心の中で繰り返し、青子は直情を抑えこんだ。",
		"「別にあなたのせいじゃないから、気にする必要はないわ。",
		"　ただ、この一瞬とお昼まで眠っていた場合を<秤|はかり>にかけたらあまりに利益の違いがあって、頭を抱えただけよ」",
		"　回りくどい返事をして、今度こそ青子は歩きだした。",
		"　静希草十郎という失礼なストレンジャーを、完全に視界から切り離して。",
		"　何を基準にして普通というのか疑問だけれど、性格はいたって<普通|ノーマル>。素朴でいい人。イメージカラーはあえて白。性別は男子。容姿はぼんやりしている。",
		"　そんな草十郎から見ると、蒼崎青子という人物はシャキシャキとよく動いて元気が良かった。",
		"　何げない動作にも無駄がなく、ピッと動いて、ピタリときれいに止まる。",
		"　物を指す時に上げる指とか、",
		"　廊下や教室を横断する時の動作とか、",
		"　時折、先行しすぎないように後ろを振り向いて同行人を確認するところとか、",
		"　その一挙一動が実に印象的で、目を引かずにはいられない。",
		"　青子はまず二年Ｃ組の教室を案内した。",
		"　先ほどの会議室よりは人の匂いは感じられたが、やはり草十郎には何をする場所なのか見当がつかなかった。",
		"　青子から短い説明を受けた後、何種類かある特別教室、体育館、食堂、更衣室、保健室と回っていく。",
		"　草十郎が行く先々で説明を求めたせいか、二階の視聴覚室を出た頃にはずいぶんと時間が経っていた。",
		"「……まずいな」",
		"　深刻な顔で、草十郎は足を止めた。",
		"「あと二十分経つと<一時|いちじ>だ」",
		"「へ？　嘘でしょ、うちの校舎そんな広くないわよ？」",
		"　たしか案内を始めたのが午前十時前だから、一時という事はかれこれ三時間は経つ事になる。",
		"　たかだか校内案内でそんな筈はないのだが……",
		"「……そうだったわね。行く先々で根ほり葉ほり訊かれちゃ、そりゃあ何時間でも経つわ。日が暮れていないのが不思議なくらいね」",
		"　青子はじろりと草十郎を見すえる。",
		"　こんな嫌味が通じる相手じゃない、と分かった上での小言である。",
		"『………え？』",
		"　が。",
		"どんな心境の変化か、草十郎は申し訳なさそうに目を伏せていた。",
		"『なんだ、コイツ―――ちゃんとしてる、じゃん』",
		"　困っている草十郎は別人のようだ。",
		"　これまでの、青子が何を言っても反応せずの無表情と違って、言い難い親近感が湧く。",
		"　そして、なぜだかやっぱり、青子は理由もなくイライラしてしまうのだった。",
		"「で、なにがまずいの？",
		"　覚える事が多すぎてパンクした、なんて言わないでね」",
		"「いや、それもあるけど。学校の事は別にして、一時になるとまずいんだ」",
		"　つい、と心配そうに視線を逸らす草十郎。",
		"　外の様子が気になるのだろうが、あいにく、この廊下に窓はない。",
		"「……へえ。時間を気にするってコトは、用事があるのね。",
		"　ふーん、そう。人の予定を引っ掻き回しておいて、自分だけ好きなようにやろうっていうんだ。",
		"　なんだ。顔に似合わずいい人ね、君」",
		"「？　いや、誉めても何もでないぞ」",
		"「誰も誉めちゃいないわよ！」",
		"　つい怒鳴ってしまった青子だった。",
		"「で？」",
		"「で？」",
		"「それで。いったい、何の用なの」",
		"　青子の言わんとする事が分かって、草十郎はああ、と落ち着いた顔で頷き、",
		"「そこは秘密にしておきたい」",
		"　深刻に、ふざけた返答を口にした。",
		"『……馴れ始めたつもりだったけど、コイツのこういったテンポには失神しそうになるわ……』",
		"　もちろん怒りで。",
		"そんな気持ちをぐっと飲みこんで、青子は極上の笑顔を作る。",
		"「静希くん？」",
		"　ずいっと一歩前に出る青子。",
		"「秘密だってば」",
		"　なんだか殺気めいたものを感じて、ずいっと一歩後ずさる草十郎。",
		"　ずいっ、ずいっ。",
		"　磁石のように、どんなにさがっても青子は近寄ってくる。",
		"　笑顔のまま、こめかみをちょっと震わせて。",
		"「これ、最後の質問にしとくわね。",
		"　―――貴方、私をからかって楽しい？」",
		"　神に誓ってそんな気はないのだが、身の潔白を証明したところで青子の無理やりな笑顔は消えないだろう。",
		"「……分かった、説明する」",
		"　降参して手を上げる。",
		"　青子も前進を止め、不似合いな笑みを消した。",
		"「実は一時からアルバイトがあるんだ。",
		"　でも、ここはそういうの禁止なんだろ？」",
		"「そうだけど……あ、禁止されてるから秘密にしようと思ったの？　バカね、それなら許可さえ下りていれば問題ないわよ？」",
		"「知ってる。試験の時に許可はもらってる」",
		"「へえ」",
		"　顔に似合わず手回しいいじゃない、と青子は顔を輝かせた。",
		"　が。",
		"「しかし、許可はひとつしかもらえなかった」",
		"「？　ひとつって、貴方、掛け持ちでバイトしてるの？」",
		"「……これでも二件減らしたんだ。",
		"　生活費だけで大変なのに、学費まで稼がなくちゃいけない。なのに、働き先はひとつだけと言うのはあんまりだと思わないか？」",
		"「……いや。あんまりなのは貴方の方だと思うけど」",
		"　青子は呆れながらも、草十郎を少しだけ見直した。",
		"　学費はおろか生活費まで自分でどうにかしているのは立派だと思う。",
		"　そういう遊びのない事情に、蒼崎青子はわりと弱かった。さっきまでの怒りも薄れてしまう程度には。",
		"　……調子を崩したのは、この世間知らずの少年から『アルバイト』なんて単語が出るとは思いもしなかっただけだ。",
		"「……そういうことなら仕方ないわね。",
		"　いいわ、行きなさいよ。事情は分かったから」",
		"「蒼崎はいいのか？」",
		"　何がいいのだか青子にはさっぱりだが、草十郎が気を遣っている事だけは分かる。",
		"　……それも、青子にはなんとなく意外だった。",
		"　もう少しこう、人の心にも鈍感な少年だと思ったのだ。",
		"「別に。私もこのまま帰るから」",
		"　ちなみに、職員室に寄っていく選択は<潔|いさぎよ>いぐらい無い。",
		"　山城曰く、転入手続きやらは終わっているというし、後は<社交辞令|おやくそく>の挨拶だけだろう。",
		"“先生、案内終わりました”",
		"“それはお疲れさま。静希くんもお疲れさま。それで、校舎をまわった感想はどうかな？”",
		"“ありがとうございます。なんというか、とても学校ですね！”",
		"“ははは、そうかそうか。うん、明日から頑張りなさい！”",
		"　そんなどうでもいい締めのイベントなぞ、彼女には何ら関係のない話である。",
		"「山城先生の事は気にしないでいいわ。",
		"　教え子に厄介な事を押しつけてふんぞり返っているぐらい職員室が好きなんだから、何時間でも待ってるでしょ。",
		"　いえ、待ってるべきじゃない？」",
		"「そうか。蒼崎がいいんなら、いいんだな」",
		"「？」",
		"　だから、何がいいんだろうか？",
		"　草十郎の言わんとするところが、青子にはやっぱりさっぱり。",
		"「それじゃ行くよ。今日はありがとう」",
		"「今日だけよ、今日だけ」",
		"　ほら、さっさと行った、とばかりに青子は片手をひらひらと払う。",
		"　その仕草が気に入ったのか、草十郎は嬉しげに笑った。",
		"　常時ぼんやりしているせいか、彼のそういった顔はきわだって柔らかく見える。",
		"　つい笑みを返してしまうぐらいの<和|なご>み度だ。",
		"　けれどやっぱり、",
		"　そういったものに反応しないのが蒼崎青子だった。",
		"「それじゃ、また」",
		"「は？」",
		"　旧知の友人みたいな言葉を残して、草十郎は廊下の先……",
		"　ではなく、隣の教室に入っていった。",
		"「ちょ―――」",
		"　その背中が、まっすぐに窓に向かっていく。",
		"　彼はおもむろに教室の窓を開けた。",
		"　十一月の肌寒い風と、おぼろだった雨の音が鮮明になる。",
		"　それが何を意味するのかを、蒼崎青子は瞬時に悟った。悟れてしまった。",
		"「いや、待て待て待てーーーーっっっ！」",
		"　今まさに、窓枠に片足を乗っける草十郎を、青子は必死の形相で止めた。",
		"「なにするつもりよ、あんたはっ！」",
		"「なにって、アルバイトに行くんだけど」",
		"「その窓は人が出入りするところじゃないの！",
		"　だいたい、ここ何階だと思ってるの!?」",
		"　言われて、あ、と声をあげる草十郎。",
		"「……死ぬところだった。二階から下りたら危なすぎる」",
		"「危ないのはあんたの頭……」",
		"　脱力しつつも<暴言|ぼうげん>をこぼすが、幸い、草十郎には聞こえていなかった。",
		"「あのね、こっちじゃ窓から人は出入りしないの。",
		"　さっき言っとくべきだったわ」",
		"「知ってるよ、時間がないんであわててたんだ。",
		"　ありがとう、これからは気をつける」",
		"　よいしょ、と窓枠から片足を下ろして窓を閉める草十郎。",
		"　見るからに下ろしたての制服は、今ので雨に濡れてしまっていた。",
		"「……いいけど、私は別に。",
		"　あなたが何処から外に出ようが関係ないもの。ただ、できれば私の前ではやらないでほしいだけよ。",
		"　それより……貴方、本当に明日から学校に来るの？」",
		"「来るよ。不安だけど、案内してもらったし」",
		"　それじゃあ、と返して、少年は廊下を走っていった。",
		"　今度こそ普通に、階段を下りて昇降口から出ていくのだろう。",
		"「……はあ。大丈夫なのか、あんなんで」",
		"　呆れながらも、走り去った彼の背中を回想する。",
		"　もうあんな田舎者とは関わりたくないのに、妙なところで気に掛かる。",
		"　心配からか、それとも癪に障るからなのか、いまいち納得のいく答えは出ない。",
		"　そもそもどうして自分はさしたる理由もなく、あのどうでもいい転入生に怒りを覚えたのか。",
		"　妙な一日、妙な転入生、妙な感情。",
		"　こうして振り返ってみると、実は怒るべきじゃなく楽しむべきコトだったんじゃないか、と首をかしげる自分もいる。",
		"「―――ま、いっか。",
		"　どうせこれっきりなんだし」",
		"　静かに響く雨の音。",
		"　灰色の空は時間の<有様|ありよう>を麻痺させる。",
		"　今はまだ午前中なのか、夕方なのかも判らない。",
		"　校舎にはたぶん自分と、山城ぐらいしかいないだろう。",
		"　電灯の消えた教室は薄暗く、ひとりになるとやけに不気味だった。",
		"　つと―――青子は左手の<袖|そで>を上げた。",
		"　飾り気のない小さな腕時計は、たしかに午後一時になろうとしている。",
		"「……時間、あってる」",
		"　言って、青子は窓ごしに地上を見下ろした。",
		"　小雨の中、制服姿の男子が傘もささずに走っていく。見慣れている筈の光景が、彼女にはひどく印象深かった。"

		"  The rain had subsided somewhat by the time she reached the school gate.",
		"  Sunlight seemed to be playing peek-a-boo behind the clouds in the distance.",
		"  It looked like it might be cleared up by early afternoon.",
		"\"...Not that it has anything to do with me, though.\"",
		"  The weather reflected her luck.",
		"  On top of being forced out of the house at such an early hour, she had to suffer through a winter rain.",
		"  I'm getting a bad feeling about this...",
		"  The sinking feeling she had only grew as she passed through the entrance and headed inside.",
		"  She didn't encounter any other students along the way.",
		"  Nor did she see anyone taking part in club activities, either.",
		"  The reception desk to the faculty room simply read \"Faculty Closed.\"",
		"  The school had given all of its students the day off.",
		"  Except those explicitly summoned, like her.",
		"  A fact that irked her more and more as the minutes passed.",
		"  She opened the door to the faculty room and headed toward the desk she had visited a number of times before.",
		"  The man at the desk wore a plain shirt and suit that were nonetheless neatly pressed.",
		"  Slim-framed glasses adorned his face, giving off an amicable yet cunning air.",
		"  The mild-mannered image this mid-twenties man presented clashed with the cigarette he smoked.",
		"  He didn't appear to have noticed her yet.",
		"\"Mr. Yamashiro?\"",
		"  She closed the door with a bang.",
		"  Showing no response to the sudden sound, Mr. Yamashiro lifted his head.",
		"\"Hey there. Good morning, Ms. Aozaki. I guess this means you got the call.\"",
		"\"Yes. They called me at home about an hour ago, out of the blue...\"",
		"  Having graduated from this high school himself, Mr. Yamashiro was not much older than the rest of the students.",
		"  For that reason, the students preferred him over the other teachers.",
		"  He always had something interesting to talk about, and kept conversations casual.",
		"    In fact, he seemed more like an older student than a teacher, but she unfortunately didn't share her fellow students' fondness for him.",
		"  She was of the opinion that teachers should come across as more austere.",
		"  Like an iron fist that could inspire both love and hate in equal measure... Not a buddy to joke and pal around with.",
		"  He was the exact opposite of how she felt a teacher should be. It was only natural that her manner towards him would be forced and unfriendly.",
		"  Not that she'd ever been wired to make friendly small talk.",
		"\"You're in a foul mood today.\"",
		"\"Today?",
		"  I'm like this every day.\"",
		"  The matter-of-fact answer perfectly matched the displeasure displayed on her face.",
		"  Her bad mood from having to get up early and the tiredness from staying up late must have collectively made her look positively adversarial.",
		"\"If you say so. Just go easy on our guest, okay? To be honest, we're not completely sure how to deal with him yet.\"",
		"\"About that. Do you wanna tell me what the hell is going on? Because I have no clue.\"",
		"  As Mr. Yamashiro met her piercing eyes, he finally understood the reason behind her tone, and slowly put out his cigarette.",
		"\"Let's start at the beginning. What did they tell you over the phone?\"",
		"\"Just that I'd be introduced to a transfer student.",
		"  They were a little hazy on the rest, though.\"",
		"  One of Mr. Yamashiro's eyebrows stood up, impressed with the brevity of her answer.",
		"  He could see that she was angry, not because she had been called to school on her day off, but because she hadn't been told why she was here.",
		"  Mr. Yamashiro chuckled sympathetically.",
		"\"If this was all a joke to you, perhaps I should just go home.\"",
		"\"Wait, wait. I didn't mean to laugh. This is not a practical joke. We could really use your help.\"",
		"\"So there really is a transfer student?\"",
		"\"Yes, but he has... how should I put it? Difficult circumstances.\"",
		"  His name...is Soujuurou. And he's a bit...well, peculiar. So we thought someone around the same age would be best suited to show him the ropes.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  She threw him an unamused look.",
		"  It was negligent of them to be pushing teaching duties on her, but she did wonder how exactly this transfer student was peculiar.",
		"  Maybe he meant the student had behavioral problems or was difficult somehow.",
		"But 'peculiar?' She didn't have the slightest idea what that meant.",
		"(You don't hear a teacher call someone that everyday.)",
		"  She had her doubts but swept them aside for now.",
		"  This wasn't the time to get distracted by more concerns.",
		"  The fact remained that this conversation was all the \"peculiar\" she could handle, and she needed more information. She was already beginning to fantasize about saying no and curling up in her warm bed at home.",
		"\"I have a question.\"",
		"\"Yes? Ah, he's a second year student like you. He's well-behaved and a good listener. He's not the most energetic individual, but that just means he'll be easier to get along with, right?",
		"  He's not in the same homeroom class as you, but I'm sure you'll get along just-\"",
		"\"I'll be the judge of that when I actually meet him.",
		"  And none of that answered my question: why me?\"",
		"  Though her tone was still stern, it was clear that she was willing to cooperate.",
		"  She had decided to put her feelings of dissatisfaction aside and focus on the task at hand.",
		"  Forcing herself to act empathetic in spite of her self-absorbed nature was something she was used to.",
		"  Paradoxically, this force of will was also the reason teachers put so much faith in her.",
		"  ...To a point.",
		"  At times, that strength shattered expectation, and on those occasions they were left with no choice but to treat it like a natural disaster and weather it until it passed. That was how Mr. Yamashiro had come to deal with her as over the past year.",
		"\"I'll ask you one more time, Mr. Yamashiro.",
		"  Why does it have to be me?\"",
		"  Pressured by a question without a clear yes or no answer, he answered.",
		"\"Well, about that...",
		"  You're probably thinking it's because you're the iron-fisted ruler of the student council and are willing to strike down both teacher and student for the good of the school, but you'd be wrong.\"",
		"\"I can't imagine any other reason you'd call me.\"",
		"  Her eyes did nothing to hide her disbelief as she glared at him.",
		"  Strength far beyond that of an ordinary seventeen-year-old girl...",
		"  ...coupled with the youthful beauty of one.",
		"  Mr. Yamashiro let slip a genuine smile, admiring the miraculous balance of qualities.",
		"\"I mean, I'd handle this myself if it was just about pure obligation. But who gets this job has nothing to do with whether they're a teacher or on the student council.",
		"  I just felt that you were the only one who would entertain this kind of a request without needing to weigh all sides. That's why I insisted it be you.\"",
		"  In other words, he knew she wouldn't say no.",
		"\"...Mr. Yamashiro.\"",
		"\"Oh, dear. Would you stop glaring at me like that already? At least put on a smile for your new schoolmate.",
		"  Look, if you're agreeing to help, we should go see him. We've already kept him waiting long enough as it is.",
		"  And because you braved the rain to get here, I'd be happy to give you a ride home.\"",
		"  Mr. Yamashiro stood up gracefully.",
		"  \"I'm good, thanks,\" she replied, before turning and walking out of the faculty room.",
		"  He had been waiting for about an hour.",
		"  While he did, the rain shower lightened into a drizzle.",
		"  His mind wandered as he listened to the sound of the raindrops.",
		"  The room was filled with neatly arranged rectangular tables.",
		"  He was the only one there.",
		"  Quite some time had passed since he had been brought to this room and asked to wait.",
		"  Even the best behaved student might have grown dissatisfied or anxious with the situation by now, but the boy stuck to his spot like a scarecrow.",
		"  He was chilled to the bone.",
		"  It was the end of November, and the low temperature in the morning had marked the start of winter.",
		"  The room was not much warmer.",
		"  The heater hadn't been turned on. Either he'd missed the teacher telling him to turn it on, or he'd never seen one in his life.",
		"  He breathed lightly on his freezing fingers as he aimlessly surveyed his surroundings.",
		"  This dreary place was apparently a meeting room.",
		"  The other students might have considered it a wonderful place to meet, but to him it was drab and overly spacious.",
		"  It was a lifeless place that reminded him of an arid cave.",
		"  Stuck in this cold room with absolutely nothing to do, his mind turned to what they wanted to discuss.",
		"\"...",
		"...Hrm.\"",
		"  Unable to come up with a solid answer, he returned his attention to the sound of the rain.",
		"  The rain hardly resembled the rain in the mountains.",
		"  Though, he could still recognize it, barely.",
		"  Its smell and sound were harsher. But at the end of the day, rain was still rain.",
		"  So even this world, alien as it was, could have something in common with the mountains...",
		"  That trivial detail perked him up a little.",
		"  He liked how the town looked soaked in rain.",
		"  Naturally, he preferred sunny weather, but he liked rain in its own way.",
		"  The fog from the rain had soaked up the scent of the soil, and it reminded him of home.",
		"  It was at times like these that he was able to numb the anxiety the city gave him.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  ...But then he let out a discouraged sigh.",
		"  How pathetic.",
		"He'd already been here two weeks and thoughts of his hometown still made him sad.",
		"  Perhaps feeling that he was being unfair to his new life, he composed himself and continued to wait patiently.",
		"  As if having a passion for distractions, his attention returned to the sound of the rain once more.",
		"  Waiting like this didn't seem to be particularly hard for him.",
		"  He quietly endured the numbing cold and the hour alone with calm, deep breaths.",
		"  As the saying goes, \"Good things come to those who wait.\"",
		"  A strong point of his or not, he was astonishingly patient.",
		"  It was certainly helping him out in this moment.",
		"  She, on the other hand, was livid.",
		"  The profile of the transfer student had been explained to her on her way to the meeting room.",
		"  She was told he had lived his whole life up in the mountains without any electricity.",
		"  That meant more than half of civilized society would have been an utter mystery to him.",
		"(What a miserable level of isolation. How is this even possible in post-war Japan?",
		"  He's like Robinson Crusoe!)",
		"  She had every right to be angry.",
		"  His village had apparently remained isolated in the mountains for many years.",
		"  Contact with villages in the foothills of the mountains only occurred once a month or so, which was unfathomable in modern Japan.",
		"  Although expressways and Japan Rail-the old National Railways-now spanned the country like arteries, it wasn't entirely impossible for mountain villages like his to exist.",
		"  But she couldn't imagine how someone born to such circumstances would think or live.",
		"\"When you say no electricity... you mean in general, right? Like, he must have had access to a public phone.\"",
		"\"Apparently not. He mentioned how shocked he was by the phones when he started living here.",
		"  I kid you not, he said, 'Wow, telephones are so useful.' Couldn't really deny that, could I?\"",
		"  She shot a sidelong glare his way as he laughed.",
		"  It seemed that the naivete of the country boy had cheered up Mr. Yamashiro a bit.",
		"\"They probably didn't have police officers, either. My family home is up in the mountains, so it's not inconceivable they wouldn't have electricity.",
		"  But... he doesn't even know what school is?\"",
		"\"Nope. He'd heard of them, but this is apparently his first time visiting one. Maybe that's why he's nervous. He wasn't very talkative.",
		"  He's almost-what would you call it-feral? Like a boy raised by wolves. I suppose that makes us Lewis and Clark?\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"\"Hey, you're scaring me, Aozaki. I was joking. Go easy, okay?",
		"  And don't worry. I got the feeling from talking to him that he's a nice kid!",
		"  He was almost like, I don't know, a cute little animal that doesn't speak human!\"",
		"\"Your jokes and metaphors aren't helping.\"",
		"  As she gave her blunt reply, she tried to simulate in her mind what life without electricity would be like, but the thought of it took her sour mood from bad to worse.",
		"  After all, it was a world she had never known.",
		"  She could understand why the teachers had given up.",
		"  She, too, wanted to give up and return to her warm bed, but her good-for-nothing pride was holding her hostage.",
		"  Not only did the teachers believe she was up to the task, but she also believed she could do it. It wasn't that easy to go back on her word-no matter how bad things looked after the fact.",
		"  She walked along the hallway, the rain pattering in the background.",
		"  The meeting room was already in sight.",
		"  With a furrowed brow, she fixed her long hair in anticipation of meeting the unknown stranger within.",
		"  Her elegant strides were like those of a confident general going into battle.",
		"\"...Umm, Aozaki?",
		"  I believe in you and all, but I'll say it again. Be nice, okay? Can you at least try to smile?\"",
		"\"I'm bad at faking smiles. But I'll do my best.\"",
		"\"Really? That's a relief...",
		"  I really mean it. It's good to know you're not good at everything.\"",
		"  Mr. Yamashiro's shoulders slumped the second they reached the meeting room.",
		"  As he put his hand to the door, his eyes seemed to say to her, \"Be nice, please.\"",
		"  This only made her more irritated.",
		"(I already know I'm not the friendliest-looking person in the world, but I can't just make myself smile at the drop of a hat.",
		"You should have asked Tobimaru if that's what you were after.)",
		"  She sighed about her social shortcomings, but then it occurred to her that being called into school on a day off while sleep-deprived wasn't anything to smile about anyway.",
		"  She also thought the person responsible for this mess would be better off attending elementary school.",
		"  It might not be his fault, but neither was it her duty or obligation to do the teachers' work for them.",
		"  At the very least...",
		"  They could have used their brains and organized all this on a normal school day-another complaint she wanted to voice later.",
		"(I hate him already. He's my sworn enemy and I haven't even met him.",
		"  Sorry, but I couldn't care less about his extenuating circumstances!",
		"  You think this isn't awkward for me, too? Honestly, why did this have to happen when I'm so busy!?)",
		"  Her pounding headache from a lack of sleep had boosted her aggression by ten percent.",
		"  No matter how harmless the guy on the other side of the door may be, anyone who disturbed her sleep was the enemy.",
		"  And just as she was reaching peak annoyance, Mr. Yamashiro opened the door to the meeting room.",
		"  The room slowly slid into view.",
		"  She didn't care for formalities,",
		"  just looked straight ahead and stormed into the room.",
		"  And found herself face to face with a most unusual opponent.",
		"  Before we go on, let's see from another perspective.",
		"  Turning back the clock just a little...",
		"\"You don't have to do anything.\"",
		"  For some, these words are a priceless luxury.",
		"  For others, they are unbearable torture.",
		"  For the proactive girl, it was definitely the former, though she'd be too suspicious of the motives of anyone giving her such a gift to accept it.",
		"  For the passive boy, it was definitely the latter. A bitter thorn that made him homesick, though at this very moment his mind was still distracted with the wait for his face to reveal any discontent.",
		"  He maintained perfect posture as he stared at the gray sky.",
		"  He had already waited a whole hour, but figured they must have had their reasons for making him wait.",
		"  And as long as he had the sound of the rain to soothe him, he could keep on waiting.",
		"(It must be nine o' clock already.",
		"  Yeah, that seems about right.)",
		"  He had been vaguely keeping track of the time as he listened to the rain.",
		"  Due to the holiday, the school building was completely silent,",
		"  except for the patter of the rain on the window.",
		"  The mood felt as damp as the air.",
		"  It was then...",
		"  ...he heard the heavy clatter of footsteps approaching.",
		"(Finally. I thought they'd forgotten about me.)",
		"  He could hear two sets of footsteps, one heavier set belonging to an adult.",
		"  He breathed a sigh of relief as the door slid open.",
		"\"So sorry to keep you waiting.\"",
		"  The first person he saw was a man wearing glasses and an awkward smile.",
		"That's Mr. Yamashiro, the one who brought me here.",
		"\"Hey, where's Mr. Satonaka?",
		"  I told him to keep you company. He shouldn't have left you here.\"",
		"  Mr. Yamashiro scratched his head, looking increasingly apologetic.",
		"  And then, from behind him...",
		"  With a tight-lipped expression that made it clear she didn't want to be there,",
		"  a dark-haired girl with a determined look in her eyes appeared.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou gulped.",
		"  The sound of the rain on the window faded into nothingness.",
		"  That's when he knew...",
		"  This was how it felt when time stood still.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  She blinked quickly a few times as if taken aback.",
		"  Why was anyone's guess.",
		"  The boy was everything she expected a naive country boy to look like. However, she felt something she couldn't understand.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  His eyes widened slightly as if taken aback.",
		"  The reason was obvious.",
		"  Putting his feeling into words was a different matter altogether. So we will never know exactly what he experienced in that moment.",
		"  That's when it hit him...",
		"  He sensed he'd been touched by the hands of destiny.",
		"\"Allow me to introduce the two of you. This is the transfer student I mentioned, Soujuurou Shizuki.",
		"  And this is the girl that will be showing you around.",
		"  She's our student council president and came in on her day off just to welcome you. Her name is Aoko Aozaki.\"",
		"  His voice and the sound of the rain seemed distant.",
		"  This is how they first met.",
		"  Such was their start, for better or worse. Like the ephemeral beauty of fireworks.",
		"  It was commonly believed among the students...",
		"  ...that Aoko was always in a foul mood.",
		"  But this gossip was ninety percent prejudice, as Aoko simply didn't have time to be irritated twenty-four seven.",
		"  The reality was she simply didn't want to explain herself all the time",
		"  and therefore seemed angry about something, obvious or not.",
		"  This idle gossip did, however, lead to her earning the title of one the school's Seven Deadly Threats.",
		"  The remaining ten percent of the gossip was right on the mark.",
		"  Aoko herself often had the feeling that her tendency to feel animosity toward harmless things was akin to what a chronic headache sufferer might experience.",
		"  Today fell under that ten percent.",
		"  For today her anger was pure,",
		"  and her childish and selfish display was befitting of her actual age.",
		"  The meeting room was dimly lit, awash in the colors of the rain.",
		"  To reduce electricity costs, school regulations forbid the use of lights during the day.",
		"  This was the setting the three of them found themselves in.",
		"  Her first impression was that his calm demeanor reminded her of a field of wildflowers.",
		"  In spite of his perfect posture, he seemed subdued and frail.",
		"  And though describing him as meek would be going too far, at the very least he was passive.",
		"  Even through his uniform, she could see that he was thinner than average.",
		"  His dark hair was unkempt, and he came across as a wholly forgettable boy.",
		"  If she had to look at him in a more positive light, she would describe him more a young man than a boy.",
		"  It was his calm demeanor that made him seem more mature.",
		"  Was that the cause of Aoko's reasonless reaction?",
		"  He seemed almost too at home in the meeting room, and she was left with the impression that it was her and the teacher, not this outsider, who were the guests here.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  She felt an unidentifiable aggravation building within her, almost as if her right to be here was in question.",
		"  Aoko felt herself raising her natural defenses.",
		"(...What's with me?",
		"  Am I really this angry for no reason?)",
		"  She hated not understanding things, her own emotions, in particular.",
		"  It pained her less than you would imagine for a perfectionist like her, but it still nagged her like a thorn in her side.",
		"\"Uh, hahaha. Aozaki, why don't you introduce yourself?\"",
		"  Mr. Yamashiro's attempt to relieve the tension was equally irritating.",
		"\"...Introduce myself, huh.\"",
		"  After casting a nasty glance in the teacher's direction, Aoko turned to face the boy.",
		"  From an outsider's perspective, it might have looked like a staredown.",
		"  And in that instant...",
		"  The culmination of her emotional state hurtled toward the innocent boy, and skewered him.",
		"\"Again, sorry for the wait, Shizuki.\"",
		"  Hearing his name, Soujuurou came to his senses.",
		"  His stunned gaze shook loose.",
		"  He took a deep breath to clear his head.",
		"  Chalking it up to nerves, Mr. Yamashiro broke out a smile and turned to the girl standing beside him.",
		"\"I'll do the introductions then. This is the transfer student, Soujuurou Shizuki.",
		"  And this is our student council president who came in on her day off just to show you around. Her name is Aoko Aozaki.\"",
		"  Having been introduced by Mr. Yamashiro, the girl took a step forward.",
		"  Her eyes were merciless.",
		"  Her stare, an unspoken threat to violently trample her opponent.",
		"  Soujuurou, on the other hand, managed to keep his own composure despite the shock at how confrontational she appeared.",
		"  He had never been greeted quite like this before, but supposed, mistakenly, that this was how people treated each other in the city.",
		"  The exchange must have looked quite dramatic to an onlooker.",
		"  A girl ready to brawl...",
		"  An earnest country boy desperate to understand...",
		"  It was a murderous limbo, especially for anyone in the room with them.",
		"  Like Mr. Yamashiro, for example.",
		"  While he had thought he had made the right decision in choosing an honor student to help him out, she was in an inexplicably bad mood, and the tension in the air was undeniable.",
		"  It was this moment that he realized his failure.",
		"  His realization had come far too late.",
		"  One false move, and this girl, for whom no problem was too large, would becoming a storm that would rock the very foundations of the school.",
		"  Just as the almighty joker card could bring either fortune or disaster, the sole teacher who had been present at the time would come to bear the blame for the scandal that ensued.",
		"\"Wow, you two really seem to have hit it off!",
		"  ...I suppose I can leave you two to it, then?\"",
		"  Mr. Yamashiro laughed nervously as he crept toward the door.",
		"\"I'll be in the faculty room. Stop by when you're finished.",
		"  You'll be alright, won't you, Aozaki?",
		"  You're the student council president! Don't let me down!\"",
		"  Mr. Yamashiro left, leaving the two in a locked-eyed state, one in which one set of eyes was doing all the glaring.",
		"  All that remained in the room was a naive boy",
		"  and a cross-armed guarded girl.",
		"  The two lingered in silence.",
		"  They resembled shogi players agonizing over their first moves, though ultimately, it was only Aoko that had considered the scene that carefully.",
		"  She decided to put her irritation aside for the time being.",
		"  With no reason to feel revulsion for him in the first place, she sighed deeply and faced Soujuurou.",
		"\"Whatever. It's not like this is the first time that Mr. Yamashiro landed me in it.",
		"So... what's your name again?\"",
		"  Her tone was nothing if not reproachful, though he had done nothing to offend her.",
		"But the boy failed to pick up on it.",
		"  Incapable of such venom himself,",
		"\"I'm Soujuurou Shizuki,\" he replied. \"And you're... Miss Aozaki, right?\"",
		"  For whatever reason, he came across as happy in his response.",
		"\"Drop the 'Miss.' That's not my style.",
		"  Is Shizuki fine?\"",
		"\"What do you mean?\"",
		"\"What do you mean, what do I mean?\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"\"Hello? Did I say something weird?\"",
		"\"Yeah, very-\"",
		"  The boy replied immediately as if it was a natural response, but quickly second guessed himself.",
		"\"Uh, never mind. That must be normal here.",
		"  You can call me Shizuki. You mind if I call you Aozaki?\"",
		"\"Suit yourself.\"",
		"  She followed her blunt reply with a swift turn away from him.",
		"  While she was hardly thrilled at the prospect of the task at hand, it had been entrusted to her, and it was her personal policy to see it through to the end.",
		"\"Sorry, but I'm not in the mood for pleasantries.",
		"  Time is short, so let's get this over with.\"",
		"\"Sure. I know your time is valuable.\"",
		"  Aoko's blunt rancor was lost on him once again.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Humans tend to be overly conscious about being ignored, whatever form that takes.",
		"  But despite being peeved at landing none of her attacks, Aoko did her best to act professional and directed her guest into the hallway.",
		"  There was no sunlight in the hallway, nor any sign of life.",
		"  This was more like a prison than the cave that was the meeting room.",
		"  As it dawned on Aoko that the hallway matched her mood, she sighed once again.",
		"\"First things first. Did you understand everything Mr. Yamashiro explained to you?\"",
		"\"Yes, I get how the school works.",
		"  But it's still a bit hard to imagine that everyone here is around the same age.\"",
		"\"...I see. Great.\"",
		"  Aoko rubbed her forehead.",
		"  This Soujuurou kid had no idea what he was in for.",
		"Apparently, all he'd heard about school was that it was a place where a lot of people met to study.",
		"  High school teachers imparted to students their knowledge in various fields of study, while fostering discipline and creativity.",
		"  But never did Aoko imagine that she would have to explain the concept of school itself to someone.",
		"  Yes, fundamentals were important. But this was absurd.",
		"  She had serious doubts whether he could even handle classes, but Mr. Yamashiro insisted that things would work out somehow.",
		"  Soujuurou had managed to pass the transfer exam, after all. Barely.",
		"(Not my problem.)",
		"  Aoko grumbled mentally as she walked down the hallway.",
		"  She consoled herself with the fact that today would be the only day she'd spend with this boy out of time... or at least, she'd try to keep it that way.",
		"\"Aozaki?\"",
		"  He asked, calmly trying to get her attention.",
		"\"What?\"",
		"\"Can I ask you something?\"",
		"\"Yes. What is it?\"",
		"\"I could be wrong about this, but you seem upset about something.",
		"  You're not a morning person, are you?\"",
		"  His gaze revealed earnest concern, as if asking her if she'd remembered to eat breakfast.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  It was like another hammer to her head.",
		"  It was true that Aoko had been glaring at Soujuurou the entire time.",
		"  Glaring red-hot daggers, in fact.",
		"  Not just at him, but the universe.",
		"  Even on her best days, her roommate used to remark,",
		"\"Most people can't handle your scowl, Aoko.",
		"  It wouldn't hurt you to be a little more tolerant.\"",
		"  She'd been warned that her emotions were so naked on her face that people treated her like a powder keg. How naive could the boy be that he could not pick up on this?",
		"(He's not making fun of me, is he? No... he couldn't be.)",
		"\"Hm?\"",
		"  Even she found her own attempt to reassure herself unconvincing.",
		"  It began to dawn on Aoko, far too late...",
		"  ...that compared to her, this laid-back transfer student might as well have been from another planet.",
		"\"Look. Let me spell it out for you, because you're just not getting it.",
		"  It's not your imagination. I am angry and anyone could see that in my eyes. It's easier than trying to make conversation.\"",
		"  In response to her words, the Martian clapped his hands together.",
		"\"That makes sense. I don't know why you'd want to do it that way, but I get that it's a faster way to express yourself.\"",
		"  Soujuurou accepted her reasoning without argument.",
		"  Though he still had no idea what kinds of emotions she was trying to express.",
		"  It was as if he could hear the words but didn't grasp the meaning.",
		"  Ideas that should have connected were instead separated into blocks.",
		"(So it's true. He really is peculiar.)",
		"  Mr. Yamashiro's words made sense to her now.",
		"  What was odd about this boy went way beyond naivety.",
		"  A stranger in a strange land he may be, but it was only civilized to forgive him some jet lag-induced confusion.",
		"\"Let's visit your classroom.\"",
		"  She had regained her composure.",
		"  Soujuurou raised his hand and stopped in his tracks.",
		"\"Just one more thing.\"",
		"  Aoko waited for Soujuurou to continue. The boy was patient to a fault.",
		"  She rubbed her forehead with her hand again, nursing a vague feeling of uneasiness.",
		"\"I wanted to ask-why are you so angry?",
		"  Is it your line of business? Or does it run in your family?\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  A long silence.",
		"  Though she knew it wouldn't change the situation, she remembered her regret at answering the phone that morning.",
		"  He meant no harm.",
		"  She repeated this thought like a mantra in an attempt to keep her impulses in check.",
		"\"It's not you, if that's what you're worried about.",
		"  I'd just... rather be somewhere else right now.\"",
		"  With that vague answer, she started to walk again.",
		"  And turned her gaze away from this rude stranger named Soujuurou Shizuki.",
		"  While what constitutes 'normal' is certainly up for debate, most would undoubtedly refer to him as so. He was a simple and nice boy with nondescript features. If he were an ice cream flavor, he would be vanilla.",
		"  And Soujuurou found Aoko to be very businesslike and full of life.",
		"  There was a certain purpose to her movements, as they began and ended in an orderly fashion.",
		"  The way her finger raised when she pointed at things...",
		"  The way she made her way across the hallways and classrooms...",
		"  The way she would occasionally glance back at him to make sure he was keeping pace...",
		"  Each and every movement was so impressive that he couldn't take his eyes off her.",
		"  Aoko showed him to his homeroom-Class C of the 11th grade.",
		"  The room certainly displayed more of a human touch than the previous meeting room, but Soujuurou was none the wiser as to its function.",
		"  Aoko gave a brief explanation before they visited individual subject classrooms, as well as the gym, cafeteria, locker room, and school infirmary.",
		"  Soujuurou asked so many questions that much time passed before they reached the AV room on the second floor.",
		"\"...Oh dear.\"",
		"  Soujuurou stopped, looking genuinely concerned.",
		"\"It's twenty to one already.\"",
		"\"Huh? You're kidding, right? This school isn't that big. We'll be done soon.\"",
		"  The tour had begun around ten, which meant that three hours had passed.",
		"  A tour of a school shouldn't take anywhere near this long.",
		"\"Maybe if you didn't ask so many questions, we'd be done by now. It's a miracle it's still light out.\"",
		"  Aoko glared at Soujuurou.",
		"  She was being sarcastic, of course, knowing full well he would never pick up on it.",
		"(...Is he...?)",
		"  To her surprise...",
		"He looked down apologetically, unable to hide his dejection.",
		"(Oops. I think I broke him.)",
		"  The guy before her now was nothing like earlier.",
		"  In contrast to seeing his once-impenetrable veneer when they first met, she found herself feeling sympathetic.",
		"  Momentarily, at least, until her irritation returned in full force.",
		"\"What's the hurry?",
		"  Don't tell me your brain's not big enough to remember all this stuff.\"",
		"\"Well, there's that, but it's more about it almost being one o'clock.\"",
		"  Soujuurou's gaze wandered as if worried about something.",
		"  If he was worried about the weather, he would have a hard time seeing it as there were no windows in this hallway.",
		"\"Don't tell me-you've got somewhere better to be.\"",
		"  Thaaat's perfect. I take time out of my day for you, and you don't have the decency to even hang around.",
		"  You're a real piece of work, you know that?\"",
		"\"Umm, thanks, I guess? That's nice of you to say.\"",
		"\"Not a compliment!\"",
		"  She yelled at him, unable to hold back her fury.",
		"\"Well?\"",
		"\"Well what?\"",
		"\"What's happening in twenty minutes?\"",
		"  Soujuurou's face lit up, as he finally understood what she was asking him.",
		"\"It's a secret.\"",
		"  He said with a perfectly straight face.",
		"(Ugh. Every time I think I've got this guy figured out, he finds a way to trip me up.)",
		"  Her frustration was natural.",
		"Still, she did everything she could to stifle her feelings and fake a smile.",
		"\"You want to repeat that, Shizuki?\"",
		"  She took a step forward.",
		"\"Like I said, it's a secret.\"",
		"  Feeling the mood change drastically, Soujuurou took a step back.",
		"  And another... And another...",
		"  No matter how many steps he took back, she kept edging toward him.",
		"  She was smiling, but he thought he could see the blood boiling beneath her skin.",
		"\"Last question:",
		"  Do you enjoy mocking me?\"",
		"  He had no intention of mocking her, though at this point he doubted presenting any evidence to prove this would do much to erase that forced smile on her face.",
		"\"...Let me explain.\"",
		"  His arms raised in surrender.",
		"  She halted her advance and freed her face from that unseemly smile.",
		"\"The truth is that my part-time job shift starts at one.",
		"  But, students aren't allowed to have jobs, right?\"",
		"\"Yeah... Wait, were you being tight-lipped because you thought you'd get in trouble? All you have to do is get permission, dweeb!\"",
		"\"I know, and I did. I got permission when they accepted me to the school.\"",
		"\"Really.\"",
		"  Aoko's face lit up as she realized he might not be the piece of work she thought him to be.",
		"  Yet...",
		"\"But I only got permission for one of my jobs.\"",
		"\"Wait, you have more than one job?\"",
		"\"Well, I quit two of them...",
		"  Living expenses are bad enough, but now I have to earn money for school as well. Don't you think it's unreasonable of them to only let me work one job?\"",
		"\"...No, I think you're the one who's being unreasonable.\"",
		"  Though still irritated, her opinion of him changed a little.",
		"  She was impressed that he was able to take care of his tuition and living expenses all on his own.",
		"  She could also empathize with having no time to oneself. Her anger began to subside.",
		"  The words 'part-time job' were about the last things she ever expected to hear out of this country boy's mouth.",
		"\"Well, you gotta do what you gotta do, I guess.",
		"  It's fine. You can go. I get it.\"",
		"\"Will you be okay?\"",
		"  She had no idea what his question meant, but she at least understood he was trying to be considerate.",
		"  Which also took her by surprise.",
		"  She figured he'd be just as dense about people's feelings as he was about everything else.",
		"\"I'll be fine. I'll just head home.\"",
		"  First, though, she thought it best that they both stop by the faculty room.",
		"  Mr. Yamashiro had mentioned that the transfer procedures had already been completed, so all that remained was for him to sign off on her duties.",
		"\"I've finished showing him around.\"",
		"\"Great job. That goes for you, too, Shizuki. What did you think of our school?\"",
		"\"Thank you for the tour. It's like a real school!\"",
		"\"Hahaha. That's great to hear. Okay, then. Best of luck starting tomorrow!\"",
		"  She had no interest whatsoever in this pointless wrap-up meeting.",
		"\"You'll have to forgive Mr. Yamashiro.",
		"  He likes the faculty room so much he chooses to kick back there while getting his students to do his dirty work for him. I bet he spends hours in there.",
		"  Actually, that's pretty smart of him.\"",
		"\"Okay, Aozaki. If you're fine with it, then so am I.\"",
		"\"Huh?\"",
		"  There it was again.",
		"  Whatever Soujuurou was getting at, Aoko had no idea.",
		"\"I'm going to get going. Thanks again for today.\"",
		"\"Yes, today. Today only.\"",
		"  She shooed him away with her hand.",
		"  His face bent into a broad smile, as if he found the gesture endearing.",
		"  It was a softer expression than she had grown accustomed to seeing out of him.",
		"  It was the kind of smile that would make anyone smile back.",
		"  Well, most people at least...",
		"  Aoko Aozaki didn't betray the slightest hint of a smile.",
		"\"See you later.\"",
		"\"Huh?\"",
		"  And with that friendly farewell, Soujuurou walked toward the end of the hallway.",
		"  Or so she thought before he turned into the next class over.",
		"\"Did he just...?\"",
		"  Soujuurou headed straight for one of the classroom's window.",
		"  Whereupon he opened it with ease.",
		"  The chilly November air filled the room as the soft sounds of the rain doubled in volume.",
		"  In that instant, she realized his intention with opening the window-she really wished she hadn't.",
		"\"Nooo! Stop stop stop STOP!\"",
		"  He already had one leg out the window when she dashed to stop him.",
		"\"What do you think you're doing!?\"",
		"\"What am I doing? I'm leaving for my job, that's what.\"",
		"\"You do know that this window isn't an exit, don't you!?",
		"  I mean, do you even know what floor you're on!?\"",
		"  She saw the light of understanding dawn in his eyes.",
		"\"...Oh my god, I almost died. Who would put an exit here!? This is dangerous.\"",
		"\"It's the lack of something between your ears that's dangerous.\"",
		"  Her insult went right over his head.",
		"\"People here don't normally enter and exit through windows, okay?",
		"  You should probably remember this information for future reference.\"",
		"\"Oh, I know. I just wanted to save some time.",
		"  But thanks. I'll be more careful from now on.\"",
		"  He pulled his leg back inside and closed the window.",
		"  His school uniform was soaking wet from the rain.",
		"\"Hey, be my guest.",
		"  Go outside any way you like, just don't do it in front of me from now on.",
		"  Anyway... You start school tomorrow, right?\"",
		"\"Yeah. I'm a little nervous, though, which is why I came in early for the tour.\"",
		"  He bid her farewell before running away down the hallway.",
		"  She hoped he would walk down the stairs and leave through the school entrance, like a normal person.",
		"\"Ugh... I wonder if he's really going to be okay here.\"",
		"  The image of him disappearing into the distance popped into her head, in spite of her ire.",
		"  She had no intention of spending any more time with him, and yet, she felt strangely anxious.",
		"  She couldn't tell if the feeling was fueled by concern or irritation.",
		"  Why had she even gotten angry with this insignificant transfer student in the first place?",
		"  A strange day with a strange transfer student resulting in strange emotions.",
		"  Her head tilted as she reflected on what should have been a more enjoyable day than the irritating experience she just had.",
		"\"Whatever.",
		"  It's not as if I'll see him again.\"",
		"  The sound of the rain echoed quietly all around her.",
		"  The gray sky seemed frozen in time.",
		"  It was impossible to discern whether it was morning or evening.",
		"  Mr. Yamashiro and Aoko were likely the only ones left at school.",
		"  The unlit classroom looked overly gloomy and ominous as Aoko stood in it alone.",
		"  She pulled up her left sleeve.",
		"  Her dainty, unremarkable watch showed that it was almost one o'clock.",
		"\"He was right about the time.\"",
		"  She looked out the window at the grounds below.",
		"  She saw a boy in uniform running through the rain without an umbrella. A sight she must have seen before, but for whatever reason, affected her far more than she wished."
