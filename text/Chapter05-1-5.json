		"“結構きついかもね、あなたの役目”",
		"　草十郎にそう告げて、青子は静かに、可能なかぎり音を殺して走り出した。",
		"　二階のほぼ中心、渦の終点には草十郎だけが残っている。",
		"“実を言うと、もう一つ用意しておいた仕掛けがあるの。",
		"　自分でもやりすぎだって呆れたもんだけど、貴方が<遊園地|ここ>に来るのが遅かったから。ちょっと興に乗っちゃって”",
		"“……？　仕掛けって、俺用の？”",
		"　リスのように首をかしげる草十郎に、青子はそ、と気軽に答えて、伏せておいた最後の切り札を提示した。",
		"“地下の<支柱|はしら>に着火型の、ちょっとした魔術式を刻んでおいたの。中心の柱に点火することで、連鎖的に他の柱に仕掛けた魔術も起動する。",
		"　ジャミングを食らう前に作ったものだから、直接魔力をたたき込めば一気に、こう、いくわ”",
		"“………………”",
		"　具体的な表現を避ける青子に、一抹の不安を隠せない草十郎なのだった。",
		"“……蒼崎。こう、じゃ分からない。できるだけ明確に、どこまで爆破する気だったのか白状してくれ。",
		"　あと、もしかして俺、早まったか？”",
		"“いや、その……単なる保険って言うか。",
		"　追いかけっこの途中でアンタを見失ったら、いっそ建物ごと爆破しちゃおうかなー、って”",
		"　なにごとも徹底しておくものねー、と照れ笑いをしながら頭を<掻|か>く青子。",
		"“いくらなんでも徹底しすぎてる！”",
		"　そんな青子の暴虐ぶりに、草十郎は状況を忘れて、心底からの感想で抗議した。",
		"「……なによ。いいじゃない、そのおかげでなんとかなりそうなんだから」",
		"　……などと。",
		"　草十郎が聞いたら<協力|けいかく>を白紙に戻しかねない<愚|グ><痴|チ>をこぼしつつ、青子は通路をひた走る。",
		"　作戦はシンプルだ。",
		"　青子は右に曲がる抜け道を利用し、人形を避けて地下一階まで移動。",
		"　地下中央の柱まで辿り着き、仕掛けておいた魔術式に直接魔力を注入し、脱出する。",
		"　魔術式が起動し、崩壊がミラーハウス全体に広がるまで早くて一分、その後の倒壊まであと一分。",
		"　……厳しいが、迷路を暗記している青子ならギリギリで脱出できるスケジュールだ。",
		"　人形による入り口の<結界|かべ>は、柱の連鎖爆破で吹き飛ぶ程度だろうと青子は予想している。",
		"　仮にもっと上等な結界だとしても、建物全体が歪んでしまえば消えざるを得ない。地下の魔術式さえ起動させれば草十郎の脱出路は確保できる。",
		"　最後に、肝心の標的について。",
		"　あのオートマタは遮蔽物だらけの<この場所|ミラーハウス>を苦手としている。アレは構造上、この地形での全速移動はできない。",
		"　建物が崩壊しだした時に二階の中心付近にいれば、倒壊に巻きこまれてあえなくスクラップだ。",
		"　なので問題は、青子が地下に行くまで、いかにして人形を二階に押しとどめておくか、という事だった。",
		"“……アテにしたからね、静希君。",
		"　せめて三分ぐらいは引き付けて―――”",
		"　青子が地下に到達し、魔術式を起動させるまで人形を引き付けてくれるなら文句なし。",
		"　もしくは、せめて一階の大広間に下りるまで囮になってくれれば、この作戦は上手くいく。",
		"　草十郎が危険なのは百も承知だが、<青子|じぶん>からあれだけ逃げ回った草十郎の運と脚力は馬鹿にできない。",
		"“……うん、ただ逃げるだけなら、もしかして―――",
		"　トンデモない事をしてくれるかも、アイツ”",
		"　などと。迷路の横道を走りながら、青子はつい、ここには居ない草十郎に期待をよせたのだった。",
		"　―――一方。",
		"　そんな青子の声が聞こえるはずもなく、草十郎は必死の追いかけっこに挑もうとしていた。",
		"　彼は自分なりの方法で<心|む><臓|ね>の動悸を押さえつける。",
		"　大事なのは落ち着く事だ。作戦自体はシンプルで、そう難しいものじゃない。",
		"　青子の指示は短く、実に分かりやすかった。",
		"“十メートルぐらいの距離を保って、できるだけゆっくり通路を三、四周する事。",
		"　横道は鏡のつなぎ目で覚えて。ここなら左回りで六、三、七、二枚目にあるから、そこをぐるぐる回ってれば比較的安全よ”",
		"　……要は円を描くマラソンである。",
		"　人形からは伸びる腕だけが届いて、ぎりぎり追跡できるじれったい距離をキープしていれば、相手はしつこく追いかけてくる筈だ。",
		"　単純作業だが、草十郎にとっては命懸けの囮役である。",
		"　加えて、建物が揺れだしたら全力で出口まで走れ、という無茶な注文付き。",
		"「……けっこうじゃなくて、かなりきついんじゃないかな、コレは」",
		"　おびえおびえのぎこちない動作で、草十郎は曲がり角から顔を出す。",
		"　……突き当たりの曲がり角からは例のオルゴールの音。",
		"　まずはここで顔を合わせて、右側のショートカットを抜けて、ループ状の鬼ごっこを開始しなくてはいけない。",
		"「…………！」",
		"　来た、と身構える。",
		"　引きつけて、引きつけて。",
		"　いつ伸びてくるか分からない腕におびえながら、草十郎は青子の説明を思いかえ―――",
		"「…………あれ？」",
		"　ところで。",
		"　一番はじめの横道は、何枚目だったっけ？",
		"　三枚目か、六枚目か、九枚目か―――",
		"「――――――」",
		"　違う。",
		"　なんか、全部違う気がする。",
		"　さっきまでは完璧に思い返せたのに、緊張からか、草十郎の頭はぐるんぐるんに回りはじめ―――",
		"　……と。",
		"　草十郎は前方にあった追跡者の<物音|プレッシャー>が、唐突に離れていく事に気が付いた。",
		"　それも予想外のスピードで、ガシャガシャと音をたてながら。",
		"「……なに？」",
		"　異様な人形のシルエットに、<唖然|あぜん>とする草十郎。",
		"　あろうことか、美しい少女のカタチをした人形は唐突に、",
		"　構造的にあり得ない変形をして、",
		"　一階に下りていった“本命”へと踵を返した。",
		"「あ―――いや、それは」",
		"　まずいな、と呟いて、途方にくれる草十郎。",
		"　失敗を悔やむ時間すらない。人形はもう影もカタチもなく、草十郎の前から走り去ってしまったのだ。",
		"“役に立つから見逃してくれ”",
		"　……などと言っておいて、コレでは立場も何もない。",
		"「…………さて、自分はこれからどうしよう」",
		"　ひとり、困ったように首をかしげる。",
		"　草十郎は<傍|かたわ>らに青子がいるかのように、暗い通路に語りかけた。",
		"　同時刻。",
		"青子は一階の広間に辿り着いた時、正しく状況を受け入れた。",
		"　耳を澄ませるまでもない。",
		"　このアトラクションが<栄華|えいが>を誇っていた頃ですら、なかったであろう<騒音|にぎわい>。",
		"　ハリネズミのお化けが鏡をけずりながら大挙して迫ってくるような、そんな、絶望に似たノイズが聞こえてくる。",
		"「…………あのドジ。三分どころか十秒<保|も>たないって、どういうコトよ」",
		"　時間を稼ぐ、どころの話じゃない。",
		"　本当、ただ逃げるだけなのにトンデモない事をしてくれやがった、と悪態のひとつもつきたくなる。",
		"「―――複数の足音―――ってコトは、二足から多脚に切り替えたのね」",
		"　反響する何人もの足音。",
		"　それだけで青子は、通路を走る、六足歩行の巨大な蜘蛛を予想した。",
		"　敵の移動速度が今までとは比較にならないのは当然だ。",
		"　反響定位による環境把握は暗闇でこそ生きる。",
		"　鏡の迷路において、視力に頼る人間より、自動人形は何倍も精確に周囲を把握している。",
		"　それでも青子に追いつけなかったのは、たんに二本足では小刻みな方向転換に耐えられなかったからだ。",
		"　多脚という安定性を持てば、そのスピードは人間を遥かに凌駕する。",
		"“どうする、どうする、どうする―――！”",
		"　混乱する思考のまま、迅速に打開策を模索する。",
		"　はっきりしているのは、ここが勝敗の分かれ目というコトだけ。",
		"　このまま足を止めていれば十秒ほどで追いつかれる。",
		"　入り口の<結界|かべ>は今の青子でも小指一本で解除できる<稚拙さ|レベル>だ。魔術と言わず、魔力を流すだけで中和できる。",
		"　青子が全力で走り続けられるのは三分強。",
		"　<我慢|スタミナ>比べはどう見ても人形に分がある。",
		"　考えられる選択肢は三つ。",
		"　一つ、出口は目の前、外に逃げる。",
		"　二つ、二階より複雑な一階の迷路に身を隠す。",
		"　三つ、地下に走って、袋のネズミとばかりに、あの人形に追いつめられる―――",
		"「―――なんだ、考えるまでもない」",
		"　決断はまたたきの内に。",
		"　立ちつくしていた両足には確かな力。",
		"　嵐はもう頭上に迫っている。",
		"　意を決して、少女は眼下の暗闇に向かって走りだした。",
		"　　何であれ、<終局|フィナーレ>は華やかに。",
		"　　鏡の城に最後の見せ場が訪れる。",
		"　入場者は二人プラス一体。",
		"　魔法使いの少女は城の心臓部である地下に走り、",
		"　自律するアンティークは少女を追いかけて魔のダンジョンへ。",
		"　一分の<後|のち>、城には微弱な青い電荷が走り抜けた。",
		"　地下一階、最深最奥のメインピラー。",
		"　城を支えているワケではないけれど、象徴であった柱を、少女は渾身の魔力をこめた拳で打ち叩いた。",
		"　この一撃で鏡の城は崩れ去る。",
		"　そんなイメージの元に放った<正拳|ストレート>は、数秒の後、イメージを真実に変換する。",
		"　城の四方の柱、地盤に刻まれた魔力を圧縮、解放させるだけの単純な発火魔術。",
		"　仕掛けは電荷をスイッチにして、ほぼ同時に発動し―――",
		"　<緩|ゆる>やかに、<速|すみ>やかに。",
		"　二年もの歳月、かたくなに滅びを<拒|こば>んだ夢の城に、臨終の<槌|つち>が下ろされる。",
		"　―――それは、喜びに似た音だった。",
		"　とうに命を失い、訪れる者のいなくなった鏡の城が迎えた、最後にして最大のショウタイム。",
		"　青子の魔力は電荷となって支柱に刻まれた魔術式を起動させ、連鎖的に、建物の息の根を止めていく。",
		"「……ごくろうさま。",
		"　でも、思ってたよりくたびれてたのね。これじゃ一分<保|も>つかどうか」",
		"　地下一階の中央広場。",
		"　呼吸を整えながら、青子は魔術刻印をフル回転させる。",
		"　魔術式を組めないのを承知の上で、その両手に青い光をまとわせる。",
		"　……乱れた呼吸は簡単には治まらない。",
		"　地下一階の中心。",
		"　中心の柱にたどり着くまで、彼女は追跡者に背中を見せることなく走りきったのだ。百メートル走十三秒の俊足は間違いなく自己記録を更新した。",
		"　その先に待っているのが<こ|・><の|・><状|・><況|・>だと承知した上で、あえぐ心臓に鞭を打った。",
		"「……入れば追ってくる。地下に行けば逃げられない。",
		"　当然よね。最後まで逃げ回ろうなんて、虫のいい話だった」",
		"　反省するわ、と青子は物言わぬ<人形|じぶん>に語りかける。",
		"　城が完全に崩れるまで残り一分。",
		"　ここに留まるかぎり、どちらも瓦礫の下敷きだ。",
		"　あの人形にとってはそれでオッケー。",
		"　もとより命のないモノ、標的である蒼崎青子を殺す事だけが彼女の<目的|ねがい>なのだから。",
		"　……そう。",
		"　要するに、敵だけが初めから必死だった。",
		"　決意の甘さに<憤慨|ふんがい>する。",
		"　もろとも死ぬ事さえいとわない相手に尻尾を巻くなんて、あまりに自分らしくなかったな、と。",

		"　……そう。永久機関と言っても、それは魔力の消費量を抑えてこその永久機関だ。",
		"　あれだけの機巧を使えば燃料はすぐにカラになり、電力である呪詛を回す事もできなくなる。",

		"　少女は出来るだけ無感情を装って、まだ倒れこんでいる少年に手を差し伸べる。",

		"「いや。突拍子もないけど、蒼崎は律儀だなって」",
		"　差し出された手を握る。",

		"「ところで。今夜はって言うけど、明日からは？」",
		"「さあ。ま、その時になったら考えるわ」",
		"　自分でもなんだかなあ、と肩をすくめる青子。",
		"　その仕草がおかしく、草十郎も笑ってしまう。",

		"　それは貴女ひとりで決めていい事だったかしら、青子？」",
		"　それは美しい鳥のさえずりにも、",
		"　無慈悲な機械の声にも似て。",
		"「―――有珠」",
		"　……震える声で、青子は少女の名を口にした。",
		"　降り立つ黒衣。",
		"　……夜はまだ終わらない。",
		"　少女の名は久遠寺有珠。",
		"　青子をして魔女と恐れさせる、",
		"目撃者は例外なく逃がさない、夜の化身がやってきた。",
		"「あれか」",
		"　静まりかえった中央広場から、案内にしたがって西に。",
		"　着いた先には曇天の夜を<背景|バック>に、<凹凸|おうとつ>の多い、<威容|いよう><異彩|いさい>な城がそびえていた。",
		"　廃遊園地の中でも<一際|ひときわ>大きい建造物。",
		"　コースターや観覧車が動のアトラクションなら、あれは静のアトラクション。",
		"　キッツィーランドの三大シンボルの一つであり、ある意味、この楽園を閉鎖に導いた魔の建物だ。",
		"　一般的に、遊園地の<迷路|メイズ>は大きく二種類に分類される。",
		"　建物の広さで来訪者を迷わす<大迷路|ラビュリントス>と、",
		"　交錯する光で来訪者を迷わすミラーハウスだ。",
		"　大迷路はその広さ、つかの間の冒険性で、多くの来訪者たちを楽しませた。",
		"　後年、刺激をより増していく他のアトラクションに押され衰退していく事になるが、それは一世を<風靡|ふうび>したものの宿命だろう。",
		"　新しいものは、次の新しいものに駆逐されなければならないのだから。",
		"　一方、ミラーハウスは古くから愛されてきた定番だ。",
		"　学校の教室ほどの広さでも鏡の設置と光の演出で来訪者を楽しませ、迷わせる。",
		"　コスト面に優れたミラーハウスは大迷路より遥かに長生きしたアトラクションだ。",
		"　両者とも新世紀には姿を消す事になるとしても、遊園地を代表する遊び場であるのは間違いない。",
		"　……が。",
		"　だからといって、その二つを混ぜるのはよろしくない。",
		"　それでは訪れた者を楽しませる迷路というより、踏み入れた者を帰さない魔境になってしまう。",
		"　さもありなん。",
		"　その魔境こそがここ、キッツィーミステリーツアー城なのであった。",
		"　係員に助けを求めた入場者、実に５パーセント。",
		"　西洋の城を模した建物は奥行き百メートルほどもあり、内部はさらに三層に分かれている。",
		"　地上二階、地下一階の迷路はすべて鏡張りで、熟練者でも脱出に三十分を要するほど複雑かつ広大。",
		"　一度足を踏み入れたが最後、むこう半日は鏡面恐怖症におちいる大迷路のなれの果てが、こうして草十郎の目の前に立ちふさがっているのだが―――",
		"「真っ暗ってワケじゃないな……電気とか、ついてるんだろうか」",
		"　そもそもミラーハウスを知らない草十郎の関心は、明かりの有無にのみ向けられている。",
		"　もう一度、蒼崎青子からの手紙を確認する。",
		"　手紙には『ミラーハウス一階ロビーで待っています』とある。",
		"　待ち合わせ場所はたしかにこの中だ。",
		"　電灯の有無はともかく、開けっ放しの入り口から見える内部はうっすらと明るい。",
		"　なら間違いないだろう、と草十郎はミラーハウスの入り口に向かって歩きだした。",
		"　……カツカツと煉瓦の道を踏みならす音。",
		"　街の喧噪は遠く、",
		"　時計の秒針は数年前から動かず、",
		"　風の音すら無い冬の夜。",
		"　そんな、第三者がいれば<固唾|かたず>を呑んで呼吸を止めそうな静寂のなか。",
		"「……えーと」",
		"　草十郎はミラーハウスの入り口で、ぴたりと唐突に立ち止まると、",
		"「ところで蒼崎。そんなところで何してるんだ？」",
		"　いま歩いてきた広場を振り返って、不思議そうに呼びかけるのだった。",
		"「！？」",
		"　勢い、身を隠していたゴミ箱ごと<突|つ>っ<伏|ぷ>す音。",
		"　……しばしの静寂。",
		"　一分ほどで廃遊園地はもとの静けさを取り戻した。",
		"　ついでに、観念したように物陰から現れる少女がひとり。",
		"「あお―――」",
		"　見知った顔と、見慣れない私服姿に声が止まる。",
		"　はらりと長髪を流して現れた蒼崎青子は、草十郎の知っている彼女とは違っていたからだ。",
		"　凛とした背筋と手足が、意志の強さをいっそう際立たせている。",
		"　まっすぐに相手を<射|い><貫|ぬ>く瞳。",
		"　<澄|す>んだ瞳は<比|ひ><喩|ゆ>ではなく、錯覚でなければ、実際に<燐|うす>い光を帯びている。",
		"　氷の無機質さと、少女としての力強さ。",
		"　その不釣り合いな組み合わせが、危機感の欠如した草十郎をして、良からぬ空気を感じさせた。",
		"　<喩|たと>えるなら、怪談でいう雪女が現実に現れたような。",
		"「……蒼崎？」",
		"　つい、と草十郎はあとずさる。",
		"　小さな驚きと違和感。",
		"　そして、それらを上回る嫌な予感に混乱しつつあるが、とにかく都会の礼儀として声をかけたのだが……",
		"「……その顔を見るに、何かあったのかといちおう聞いておくん、だけど―――」",
		"「――――――」",
		"　挨拶もなく、青子は一歩前に進んだ。",
		"　その姿、その雰囲気が草十郎の曖昧な記憶を揺さぶる。",
		"　心中、交錯しまくっていた草十郎の不安は、そろそろ確信に変わりつつある。",
		"　あの時は後ろ姿だけだったが、今にして思えば夜の公園で見た人影と目前の少女の姿はなんとなく……",
		"　どころか、うり二つではないだろうか？　と<固唾|かたず>など呑む始末。",
		"「何をしていたかって話なら、見ての通りよ。",
		"　ここで獲物が通り過ぎるのを待ってたの。貴方が入ってから私も入って、逃げ道を無くすつもりだったから」",
		"　なのにいきなりコレとはね、と腐りながら青子は言った。",
		"“そうか。待ち合わせ場所はあってたんだな”",
		"　良かった、と内心でホッとする草十郎。",
		"　わりと余裕があるのか、それとも事ここに至ってやっぱり現状が把握できていないのか。",
		"　そんな草十郎の<鈍|にぶ>い反応をあえて無視して青子は続けた。",
		"「―――私はね、静希君。",
		"　嫌いな人とか、憎い人とかは人並みにいるんだ。",
		"　ただ、ちょっとヘンなのが敵になる奴の条件でね」",
		"　凍った<双眸|そうぼう>に火のような感情がともる。",
		"　彼女の足はさらに一歩前へ。",
		"　草十郎はますます嫌な予感……殺気、というのだろうか？……を覚えてあとじさりする。",
		"　ふたりの距離は、なんだかんだときっかり五メートルをキープしている。",
		"「昔から、私は嫌いな相手でも敵と思った事はなかったの。",
		"　でも逆に、好きな相手を敵だと思う事もあった。",
		"　理由は単純―――」",
		"　そして、彼女は右腕を目前に<掲|かか>げた。",
		"　洋服ごしに光って見えるのは目の錯覚ではなく―――",
		"「―――当たり前のことだけど。",
		"　私は、私の感情を乱す奴が敵なのよ」",
		"　掲げられた右腕が振るわれる。",
		"　瞬間、",
		"　何か、視認しづらい物騒なモノが、草十郎から二十センチばかり左にズレて放たれた。",
		"「ちょっ……」",
		"　青い光とも、火の玉ともとれる発火現象を目の当たりにして、草十郎はようやく現状を把握した。",
		"「ちょっと待った、今のはたいへん見覚えがある！」",
		"　そんな間の抜けた感想は聞き流し、",
		"「ち、外したか」",
		"　なんてコトを、青子は呟いた。",
		"　青い光はミラーハウスの壁にこぶし大の穴をあけたばかりか、未だにゴウゴウと<燻|くすぶ>っていた。",
		"　あれなら人間ひとりの<頭蓋|あたま>を<陥没|かんぼつ>させる事も、まるっと<黒|くろ><焦|こ>げにする事も可能だろう。",
		"「……はあ。こんな射程で外すなんて、有珠に見られたら自殺ものね。",
		"　でもこれで分かったでしょ？　二度目だものね、貴方にとっては」",
		"「――――――」",
		"　急速に腰が引ける草十郎。",
		"　理解不能を通り越して思考停止まで一歩手前。",
		"　瞳に<映|うつ>るのは頼れる生徒会長……だったもの……の姿と、二日前に目撃した夜の公園のフラッシュバックだけだ。",
		"　彼には経験がなく、また、法治国家に住むほとんどの人々には経験がない事だが。",
		"　指を引くだけで人間を殺せる凶器を向けられた時、知性は善悪はおろか夢と現実、過去と未来の判断を停止させる。",
		"　それまでの生活が平穏であった分だけ、その停止はより強いものになるだろう。",
		"　思考にあるのは「生きている今の自分」の姿だけ。",
		"　白紙の上にぽつんと置かれた黒い点と変わらない。",
		"　後も先もない、ただそれだけの状態。",
		"　それが銃口を向けられた人間の、ごく平均的な思考である。",
		"「あ、<命乞|いのちご>いは止めてね。意味ないから。",
		"　でも恨み言ならご自由に。殺す側の義務として、一言一句聞いてあげる」",
		"　意味がない、とは、一切聞かない、というコトらしい。",
		"　もっとも、草十郎はショック状態で声をあげる行為そのものが思いつかない。",
		"　確かな事は―――そう、理由はともかく、目の前の少女が自分を殺したがっている現実だけ。",
		"『う、嘘つきにもほどがある……！",
		"　鳶丸のバカ、何が“そんな生き物はいない”だ！",
		"　実際いるじゃないか、こんなお化けみたいなのが……！』",
		"　もし口に出していたら間髪入れず第二撃が飛んできたであろう感想を、草十郎はすんでのところで心にとどめた。",
		"　友人への悪態で<麻痺|ショック>状態から<恐慌|パニック>状態に持ち直す。",
		"　しかし、それは決して余裕からきたものではない。",
		"“ある日突然、何者かに殺される”",
		"　その、あまりにも<経緯|りゆう>のない非日常は、",
		"『でも、そうだった……都会には<殺|・><人|・><事|・><件|・>がある。",
		"　ルールを破れば殺されるのは当たり前だって、ちゃんと教えてもらってた……！』",
		"　都会に慣れていない草十郎にとって、極めて現実的なものだったからだ。",
		"　彼にとって同級生に殺される現実は、そう驚くべき事ではないらしい。",
		"　人が人を殺す<事件|ケース>が起こりえる社会ならば、そういうコトもあるだろうと受け止められる。彼は青子の行為、凶行にいたる経緯に、なんら疑問を持っていない。",
		"　なので、いま彼を混乱させているものは、青子が起こしている発火現象だけなのだった。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　草十郎の喉がごくりと唾を飲みこむ。",
		"　その反応は、誰の目にも恐怖で<痺|しび>れている犠牲者に見える。",
		"「そういう事よ。ようやく理解してくれたわね。",
		"　多くは語らないけど、貴方にはここで死んでもらう。",
		"　魔術は<隠匿|いんとく>するもの―――なんて言ってもそっちには関係のない事だし。単に運がなかったって思えばいいわ。大事なのは、私が、貴方を殺したってコトだけだから」",
		"　さて、とばかりに青子は再度、右手を<掲|かか>げた。",
		"　機械を思わせる駆動音。",
		"　<袖|ふく>の下で青い光が回転している。",
		"　それがさっきより長い―――つまり、きっと、いま背後の壁を燃やしているものよりずっと強い―――ことに気づいて、草十郎の混乱は加速していく。",
		"“いや、なんだ、つまり、始末するとかしないとか、あの夜のお化けは蒼崎だったとか、都会はホントに込み入ってるとか、そういうコトじゃなくて―――”",
		"　混線する思考。",
		"　早鐘を打つ心臓。",
		"　―――もう立ち尽くしている場合じゃない。",
		"　目の前の少女が同じ人間であるかさえ怪しいが",
		"　それはともかく、やっぱり、たとえ納得がいくといってもきちんと考えてみたら、",
		"「まて、人殺しはいけないんだぞっ……！」",
		"　この通り、いくら都会のルールだからって殺されるのはご<免|めん>こうむる……！",
		"「分かってるわよ、そんな事はっ！」",
		"「ちょっ、待―――！」",
		"　あまりにも空気を読まない草十郎の意見は、的確に青子の<逆鱗|げきりん>に触れまくった。",
		"「うわああああ――――――！！！？」",
		"　連続で<撃|う>ち出される青い<魔弾|まだん>と、",
		"　とっさに背後の闇―――ミラーハウスの入り口に駆けこむ草十郎。",
		"「はっ―――なななんだ、今のなんだ―――！？」",
		"　無我夢中で長い通路を走る。",
		"　たった二メートルの全力疾走で息が上がっているのは初撃を上回る“見たこともない出来事”への驚きと、本気で、あと一秒でも飛びのくのが遅かったら死んでいた、という実感のせいだ。",
		"　足を止める余裕はない。",
		"　草十郎の後ろには容赦のない足音が迫っている。",
		"「……けど助かった。ここならなんとか―――」",
		"　なるかもしれない、と全力で走る。",
		"　ミラーハウスは入り口からエントランスにあたるロビーまで、細長い通路が二十メートルほど続いている。",
		"　このままロビーまで逃げこめば、あとはいくらでも隠れ場所はありそうだ。",
		"『助かった……！』",
		"　大きな空間にたどり着く。",
		"　ここが一階ロビー。通路は三つ。",
		"　地下に下りる階段と、",
		"　一階迷路への入り口通路と、",
		"　二階に上る階段。",
		"　今はどれでもいい、と草十郎は直感的に一階の迷路へ逃げこもうと踏みこんで、",
		"「痛……！？」",
		"　がいーん、と透明の壁に頭からぶつかった。",
		"「か、鏡……!?」",
		"「ええ。面倒だけど、それならフェアでしょ？",
		"　追いかける方にも逃げる方にも有利不利がある」",
		"　どことなく楽しげな声が届く。",
		"　いちいち振り向くまでもない。",
		"　いま彼を<弾|はじ>いた鏡に、ゆっくりと歩いてくる蒼崎青子の姿が映っている。",
		"「それと、一階の奥にある出口は封鎖しといたから。結界じゃなくて物理的に。",
		"　やりすぎて封鎖っていうより瓦礫？　土砂崩れ？　どっちでもいっか。とにかく下手に出口に近づくと崩落に巻き込まれるから。生き埋めがイヤなら近寄らないことね」",
		"「―――、―――！」",
		"　近づいてくる足音に焦りながら、草十郎は手探りで壁に向かう。",
		"　見えているのは二階への階段だ。",
		"　青子の言っている<内|コ><容|ト>はさっぱりだが、一階はまずい、という事だけは確かだった。",
		"「ま、私としてはそっちのが助かるけど。",
		"　形式上、事故死の方が後始末とか楽だから」",
		"「……！」",
		"　背後には正体不明の生物。",
		"　彼女は軽口と共に、これみよがしに右腕を持ち上げる。",
		"　……それは服の上からでも分かる、少女の体には不釣り合いな、一種奇怪な<紋様|もんよう>だった。",
		"　皮膚の下の血管。",
		"　身体を巡る機能の一つが、人間以外のモノで回っているような。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　それを傷ましいとも、おぞましいとも感じたのか。",
		"　一瞬だけ足を止める草十郎と、",
		"　その視線を受け流す追跡者。",
		"「ああ、これ？　普段は塗り薬で隠しているんだけど、今日は特別。",
		"　魔術刻印って言ってね、魔術師の証みたいな物よ。",
		"　ほら、光が回ってるでしょ？　これがさっきのスナップ……分かりやすくいうと弾丸のもと。",
		"　今日は調子いいし、私、魔力を効率よく使うのだけは自信あるし―――うん、あと三十回ぐらいかな？　さっきみたいな掃射ができるのは」",
		"　感情がハイになっているのか、彼女はやけにフレンドリーな口調だった。",
		"「…………」",
		"　もっとも、会話の内容は物騒なコトこの上ないのだが。",
		"「……そもそも、何を言っているかよく分からないんだけど、蒼崎」",
		"「分からない？　弾数はあと三十発って事。",
		"　そこまで逃げ切ればあなたの勝ちよ。とりあえず、今日のところはね」",
		"『……今日はって、明日もあるのかな……』",
		"　眉をひそめて悩む草十郎。",
		"　恐慌しながらも、やはり根っこのところで危機感のない態度に、青子も<微|かす>かに眉を寄せる。",
		"　やっぱりこいつは理解できない、と。",
		"「宣言はしたわ。自由時間はこれでおしまい。",
		"　まだ<罵|ののし>り足りないだろうけど、ま、その手の時間はキリがないしね。このあたりで<諦|あきら>めて」",
		"　どうも、この<弛緩|しかん>した会話劇は<意|い><図|と>的に用意されたものらしい。",
		"　届かない命乞いではなく、殺人者を呪う<時間|けんり>。",
		"　……青子流の公正さなのだが、締まらないコトに、今回はうまく機能しなかったようだ。",
		"「とにかくそういう事だから。",
		"　―――じゃ、狩りの時間といきましょうか」",
		"　感情を<排|はい>した声と、冷酷に獲物を見据える瞳。",
		"　それで今度こそ本当に、自分が殺されるという現実を、草十郎は実感した。"

		"\"Just so you know, this is going to be pretty tough for you.\"",
		"  Aoko warned Soujuurou, moving as fast as she could without her footfalls causing a din of noise.",
		"  Soujuurou remained near the center of the spiral maze on the second floor.",
		"\"I'll let you in on a secret: I have another trap up my sleeve.",
		"  I think I might have gone overboard with this one, but when you didn't show up on time, I just couldn't help myself.\"",
		"\"A trap? For me?\"",
		"  Soujuurou tilted his head like a squirrel as Aoko freely discussed the final ace up her sleeve.",
		"\"I engraved an ignition formula into the support pillars in the basement. If I ignite the central pillar, it will start a chain reaction that will ignite the rest.",
		"  I made it before that thing started jamming me, so if I infuse it with a bit of magical energy, it'll go boom.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou was a little unsettled by how unclear that last bit was.",
		"\"...Aozaki, could you, um, clarify? I want to know how much you were going to blow me up. Please be honest.",
		"  Also, did I make a mistake agreeing to team up with you?\"",
		"\"Don't be silly. It was just an... insurance policy. Yeah.",
		"  I just thought that if I lost sight of you at any point, I could blow the whole building and you with it.\"",
		"  It was her policy to be thorough to the end, after all. She laughed in embarrassment saying it out loud, though.",
		"\"Don't you think that's overkill!?\"",
		"  Faced with Aoko's cruelty, Soujuurou forgot about the situation at hand and protested from the bottom of his heart.",
		"\"...Stop complaining. At least now we have a way to fight back.\"",
		"  She shot back.",
		"  Aoko dashed down the corridor mumbling things that probably would have sent Soujuurou packing if he heard them.",
		"  The strategy was simple.",
		"  Aoko would use the escape route to the right and avoid the puppet while making her way down to the basement.",
		"  Upon reaching the central pillar, she would infuse the formula she had prepared with magical energy and escape.",
		"  Once ignited, it would take about a minute for the chain reaction to spread throughout the whole house of mirrors, and another minute for the building to collapse.",
		"  ...She would be cutting it a little close, but because she had committed the maze to memory, she was sure she could make it out in time.",
		"  Aoko assumed that the chain reaction caused by the pillar would clear the barrier that the puppet had placed at the entrance.",
		"  And even if it was strong enough to withstand the blast, it would not be able to stay standing once the foundations buckled. Soujuurou's escape was assured as long as the formula in the basement was activated.",
		"  Next came the most important part.",
		"  The automaton was at a disadvantage in the obstacle-laden house of mirrors and was unable to move at full speed.",
		"  If it was near the center of the second floor when the building collapsed, it would be caught up and crushed by it.",
		"  So the problem was keeping the puppet on the second floor until Aoko could make it down to the basement.",
		"\"...I'm counting on you, Shizuki.",
		"  I just need you to keep it occupied for three minutes.\"",
		"  Ideally, he would be able to keep it busy until she could activate the formula.",
		"  If that failed to work, him luring it down to the first floor would be the next best thing.",
		"  She understood perfectly well the danger she was putting Soujuurou in, but his lucky streak and running speed were nothing to scoff at.",
		"\"As long as all he has to do is run, then maybe...just maybe...",
		"  Just maybe... he can actually pull this off.\"",
		"  Aoko made her way through the hidden passage of the maze, her hopes pinned on Soujuurou.",
		"  Meanwhile...",
		"  Well out of earshot, Soujuurou was readying himself for another desperate chase.",
		"  He calmed his beating heart using a method of his own making.",
		"  What mattered most was that he remained calm. The plan was simple enough,",
		"  and Aoko's orders were succinct and easy to understand.",
		"\"Keep a distance of around ten meter and weave through the corridors as slowly as you can three or four times.",
		"  Count the mirrors as you move to locate the hidden passages. From here, they are on the sixth, third, seventh, and second mirrors counterclockwise. Use those, and you should be relatively safe.\"",
		"  It was essentially a looping marathon.",
		"  As long as Soujuurou maintained a distance of the puppet's extended arm and just enough that she could continue to track him, she should continue chasing him indefinitely.",
		"  Simple though the task was, Soujuurou was putting his life on the line as bait.",
		"  And then there was the final order to run as fast as he could to the exit when the building began to sway.",
		"\"This is more than just a little tough...\"",
		"  He nervously stuck his head out from around the corner.",
		"  He could hear the sound of the music box from the other side of the corridor.",
		"  First he had to make eye contact with it, then head through the shortcut on the right, and begin their game of tag.",
		"\"...!\"",
		"  He spotted it and braced himself.",
		"  Closer... Closer...",
		"  Fearing that her arm could fly at him at any moment, he went over Aoko's instructions in his head.",
		"\"...Wait.\"",
		"  However...",
		"  He could not quite remember which pane led to the first hidden passage.",
		"  The third? The sixth? The ninth...?",
		"\"...\"",
		"  No...",
		"  He was sure that was mistaken...",
		"  He was confident he had it memorized moments ago, but his nerves had gotten the best of him, and his head was now spinning.",
		"  ...Then.",
		"  Soujuurou realized that the sound of his pursuer was beginning to growing distant.",
		"  And at an incredible speed.",
		"\"...What's it doing now?\"",
		"  The unusual silhouette of the puppet astonished him.",
		"  Before it had taken the form of a beautiful girl,",
		"  but now it made a bizarre transformation,",
		"  and returned to the first floor to pursue her primary target.",
		"\"Oh... This isn't the plan.\"",
		"  Soujuurou was no longer sure what to do.",
		"  With not even the time to mourn his failure the puppet had vanished out of sight.",
		"\"I'll be of help. Just let me go...\"",
		"  Or so he had said, but now he could not follow through.",
		"\"...So. What am I supposed to do now?\"",
		"  Alone, he tilted his head in frustration.",
		"  He spoke into the darkness as if Aoko would be there to answer him.",
		"  That very moment.",
		" Having arrived on the first floor, Aoko quickly understood what had transpired above her.",
		"  She did not even have to strain her ears to hear the puppet.",
		"  Even during its heyday, this attraction had never made sounds like the one she heard coming toward her now.",
		"  It was the sound of despair, as if a horde of monstrous hedgehogs were scraping their way past the mirrors in her direction.",
		"\"...That ditz. Three minutes? He couldn't even last ten seconds.\"",
		"  Rather than buying her time, Soujuurou had in fact stolen hers.",
		"  She dreamed of cursing him for failing to fulfill his one job.",
		"\"...Multiple simultaneous footsteps... So it switched from bipedal to its multi-leg form?\"",
		"  The echoes made it sound like the footsteps of dozens of feet.",
		"  To Aoko, it sounded like a giant, six-legged spider, tearing its way down the corridor.",
		"  It was little wonder that it was so much faster than before.",
		"  Its perception of its surroundings through echolocation was of particular use in the dark.",
		"  Compared to sight-dependent humans, this automaton was far better equipped to navigate its way through the labyrinth of mirrors.",
		"  If it could not keep pace earlier it was because its bipedal mode of movement was not up to the task.",
		"  But the stability provided by multiple legs gave it speed that far exceeded that of any human.",
		"(What now? What now!?)",
		"  Her thoughts spun out as she tried to come up with a plan B.",
		"  All she knew for sure was that this was a pivotal moment.",
		"  If she continued standing still, she had seconds left at most.",
		"  Even in her current state, she knew she could easily neutralize the Bounded Field blocking the entrance without casting a spell. All she had to do was pour a little of her own energy into it.",
		"  Aoko could sprint with all her might for a little more than three minutes.",
		"  The puppet had far more stamina than she did.",
		"  She could only come up with three options.",
		"  The first was to escape through the exit in front of her.",
		"  The second was to hide herself somewhere within the far-more complicated first floor.",
		"  And the third was to run into the basement and be stuck like a rat in a trap.",
		"\"Well, that's obvious enough.\"",
		"  She made her decision with zero hesitation,",
		"  moving her stiff legs again with determined strength.",
		"  The oncoming storm was almost upon her.",
		"  Her resolve firm, she turned and ran, descending into the darkness.",
		"    No matter what, a finale should be glorious.",
		"    This would be the mirror castle's final scene.",
		"  Two humans and a puppet.",
		"  A young sorceress ran toward the subterranean heart of the castle,",
		"  while an autonomous antique chased its prey into the depths of a demonic dungeon.",
		"  A minute later, a faint, blue charge would ripple through the castle.",
		"  This was the main pillar in the deepest depths of the basement.",
		"  The pillar itself was not there to support the castle's structure, but it would serve nicely as the symbol into which the girl thrust her fist with all of her magical energy.",
		"  This was the blow that would bring down the castle.",
		"  She imagined the scene as she threw the punch, a scene that would soon become reality.",
		"  It was simple ignition magecraft, meant to release the condensed magical energy engraved into the four pillars that formed the foundation of the structure.",
		"  Using electricity as a switch meant virtually instantaneous activation.",
		"  Swift and elegant.",
		"  A hammer of destruction descended upon the castle of dreams that had stubbornly resisted its fate for two years.",
		"  It was almost a joyous sound.",
		"  And so, the lifeless and abandoned castle of mirrors set the stage for its final and most spectacular performance.",
		"  Aoko's magical energy became an electrical charge that activated the magecraft formula engraved into the pillar. The chain reaction would lead to the castle's destruction.",
		"\"...You served your purpose.",
		"  But it must've been rough. Looks like you're gonna collapse anytime now.\"",
		"  The plaza in the center of the basement.",
		"  Aoko tried to steady her breathing while rotating her Magic Crest at full speed.",
		"  She wreathed her arms in blue light, fully aware that she could no longer activate another formula.",
		"  Her labored breathing refused to settle.",
		"  She stood at the center of the basement.",
		"  Without being spotted even once, she had managed to make it all the way to the central pillar. It was a hundred meter dash in thirteen seconds flat. Undoubtedly a new personal best.",
		"  She spurred on her weakened heart, knowing full well the fate that awaited her.",
		"\"It can't help but follow me. And once down here, there'll be no escape.",
		"  I should've expected that. It was too much to expect that I could keep up the chase forever.\"",
		"  Hindsight was 20/20.",
		"  The castle was only a minute away from collapsing completely.",
		"  If they stayed here, they would both be crushed by the rubble.",
		"  The puppet certainly did not care.",
		"  With no life of its own, its sole concern was the elimination of its target, Aoko Aozaki.",
		"  ...Indeed.",
		"  The enemy had been willing to die from the start.",
		"  She resented her own lack of resolve.",
		"  It wasn't like her to tuck tail and run from an opponent that didn't fear death.",
		"                    \"<Vivo in somno. Solitarie putresco in inferis|In slumber, I live. In dirt, I rot.>.",
		"        <Hic dies meus obitus dies, et meus nativus dies. Te obeam.|Today is the day I died and was born. Now I come to you.>\"",
		"(Hmph. It's always been on a suicide mission, huh.",
		"  It doesn't have enough juice to power the six-legged form and the Finn Shots. The curses aren't recharging it fast enough.\")",
		"  Such a perpetual motion device was only as good as its ability to regulate its energy consumption.",
		"  Using so many functions at once meant it was burning through fuel quickly and losing the ability to process the curses that powered it.",
		"  It was using up all of the functions it had been given to achieve its aim.",
		"  This was the pride of a tool, if such things could have ego. Those endowed with sentience could never hope to understand.",
		"  A beast born to do nothing but run would burn any human who faced its resolve.",
		"\"...It's a waste when you think about it.",
		"  I thought my sister was the only one capable of something this reckless, but I guess I was wrong.\"",
		"  But Aoko did not intend a sacrifice play here.",
		"  She respected her adversary now, and she was done regretting her choices.",
		"  There was no time to waste.",
		"\"This is it. This ends now.\"",
		"  Aoko had every intention of paying it back double for what it had done to her.",
		"  The energy Aoko had accumulated exploded out of her right leg.",
		"  She aimed for a single thing: A head-on attack!",
		"  The enemy's response was a curse to crush her heart.",
		"  A curse that would rend Aoko's heart, and destroy itself in the process.",
		"\"Huah!\"",
		"  As soon as she saw it, Aoko kicked the floor as hard as she could.",
		"  Her long hair swirled through the air as she flipped aside.",
		"\"...Hnnh.\"",
		"  This lateral move almost sent her tumbling to the ground, but a quick swing of her arm allowed her to regain her balance.",
		"\"...!\"",
		"  A shot grazed her arm,",
		"  with the curse scorching her left shoulder.",
		"  She did not flinch. Aoko knew she could hold on as long as she continued to avoid a direct Finn Shot.",
		"\"...!\"",
		"\"Snap!\"",
		"  Off balance and in pain, it took her half a second to recover.",
		"  The moment she raised her head, she deflected the attack with a fist full of magical energy.",
		"\"Here goes...!\"",
		"  If the puppet had a will of its own, its eyes would have popped right out of its sockets.",
		"  It would have been floored.",
		"  Shocked at the strong will that allowed this girl to perform a series of moves like this.",
		"\"Crack!\"",
		"  Aoko's response was instantaneous.",
		"  While her power was not sufficient to completely redirect the arm's trajectory, it was just enough to deflect it harmlessly past her hair.",
		"\"...<Initio erraveramus. Dum vivimus dolores sunt|It was all a mistake. I should have never been born.>.",
		"<Nemo adiuvat. Nemo adiuvat. Nemo adiuvat.|Atone for me! Atone for me! Atone for me!>\"",
		"  The chant became a curse that robbed Aoko of her vitality.",
		"\"...Hah.\"",
		"  Did it still have something left in the tank, or was it actually indignant?",
		"  Whatever the reason, Aoko was easily able to resist its weakened defensive maneuver...",
		"\"Glider!\"",
		"  ...And her right leg, pulsing with magical energy, shot up into the puppet's chest from below.",
		"  It was much lighter than Aoko anticipated.",
		"  Or rather, she felt little resistance.",
		"  An automaton's weight was determined by its internals―the size of its power source.",
		"  Ironically, it was the superiority of its music box engine that would prove to be its downfall.",
		"\"...<Venite, Venite, Venite, meum sepulchrum veniteeeeeeee|Welcome! Welcome! Welcome my graaaaaave>...\"",
		"  A stuttering curse.",
		"  Having taken the full brunt of Aoko's kick, the puppet bounced from ceiling to floor, collapsing in a heap.",
		"  Its internal construction had been warped by the impact, leaving the drum of the music box that powered the puppet warped as well.",
		"\"Take your design flaws up with your maker.",
		"A single dynamo would have been all you needed to―",
		"Wait, what the...?!\"",
		"  Part of the ceiling came crashing down in front of Aoko, snapping her back to her senses.",
		"(...Did I really just take her out?)",
		"  She was so stunned by her own victory that she forgot the house of mirrors had already begun to collapse.",
		"\"I've gotta get out of here!\"",
		"  There was no time to relish in her victory or pity her opponent.",
		"  Not unless she wanted to meet the same fate.",
		"  As the situation stood, she found it hard to imagine getting out alive.",
		"\"Get a move on, Aoko!\"",
		"  She slapped herself on the cheek and took off.",
		"  This was her bounty for finishing their battle in a matter of seconds.",
		"  With her breathing labored by all the excitement, she ran for the exit.",
		"  The collapse was intensifying by the second.",
		"  Having lost its support pillars, the castle was buckling under its own weight.",
		"\"Out of my way!\"",
		"  Escaping from the basement was proving to be no easy task.",
		"  While she was taking the shortest route possible through the maze, she was nearly crushed by a falling piece of the ceiling along the way.",
		"This was the second time―no, third―she had to deal with fallen rubble along the way.",
		"  She destroyed the debris on the stairs with magic bullets as she ran.",
		"  The automaton's jamming had long since worn off.",
		"  The earlier attack had damaged the vast majority of its functions.",
		"\"-, -!\"",
		"  Her breathing was heavy as she ran.",
		"  The intensity surrounding her sparked her brain into overdrive.",
		"  The ceiling seemed to be collapsing in slow motion.",
		"  For her, a second felt like five.",
		"  Her frayed nerves made it hard to read time correctly.",
		"  As her life seemed to flash before her very eyes, a light at the end of the tunnel...",
		"  There was debris riddled throughout the stairway, forcing her to crawl up it.",
		"  She emerged from the destroyed basement into the collapsing first floor.",
		"  That the plaza was still traversable at all was a miracle in itself,",
		"  and fortunately for her, the crucial path to the exit was still intact.",
		"\"I made it!\"",
		"  The corridor to the entrance was still intact.",
		"  The basement maze only extended as far as the plaza, so the entrance corridor wouldn't collapse. Only the ceiling would cave in, leaving the scaffolding surround intact.",
		"  She got herself this far by telling herself repeatedly that fate would decide whether or not she reached the plaza.",
		"  Her gamble paid off. It was her lucky day.",
		"  All she had to do was muster the last of her strength and keep moving forward, until―",
		"\"...\"",
		"  She hesitated for a fraction of a second.",
		"  Was it naivety? A sense of responsibility?",
		"  She pushed aside the image that popped into her head and continued running down the corridor.",
		"\"...We don't have the luxury of coordinating the timing with each other to pull this off.",
		"  It's not the greatest plan in the world, but we both need to do our parts and get to the exit as quickly as possible.\"",
		"  That was five minutes ago.",
		"  At the time, Soujuurou had nodded with trepidation.",
		"  And Aoko had not bothered to ask herself why.",
		"\"What are you thinking, Aoko?! Just focus on running!\"",
		"  This corridor was giving out too.",
		"  If she were to look back, she was sure she would see the building collapsing in on her.",
		"  She was also sure she had no time to waste doing so.",
		"  Her luck was fading as fast as the building's structural integrity.",
		"  It was a small miracle that she had escaped serious injury up to this point, and she could not afford even the slightest slip-up.",
		"  An ankle sprain, loss of balance, even a sneeze would be fatal. A simple pat on the back was enough to end it.",
		"  So, naturally...",
		"\"...Oh.\"",
		"  There it was, clear as day.",
		"  From the detritus of the stairway, death had arisen to take her down with it.",
		"  A corpse that had crawled its way up from the depths of hell itself.",
		"  It was still operational.",
		"  And it was still armed with curses.",
		"  It had crawled after her, watching as Aoko desperately tried to save herself.",
		"  The puppet's arm shot forward.",
		"  While Aoko did not turn to meet it, she could see its reflection in the mirrors.",
		"\"Iis salvatio Iis salvatio Iis salvatio Iis salvatio.\"",
		"  Extend. Extend. Extend.",
		"  This time, she could not dodge it. There was absolutely nothing she could do.",
		"  The puppet with her face sang.",
		"  <I invite you|@_Venite domum meam.>.",
		"  <to die a muddy death|@_Luto simile somnium>.",
		"  <Become as whispering dust|@_et pulveri simile cotidianum.>.",
		"  <Gouge out your heart|@_Cor privo.>.",
		"                                      ",
		"  \"<Death be upon you!|Te iudico.>\"",
		"\"Wha―\"",
		"  For a moment, she could not believe her eyes.",
		"  This was the last thing she expected to see.",
		"\"Don't know when to give up, do you?\"",
		"  A fierce expression adorned the face of the boy who had been waiting in the plaza, as he smashed the puppet's outstretched arm.",
		"  Anger really did not suit him at all.",
		"  His weapon of choice was a fire extinguisher.",
		"  He must have searched the maze for something to use as a weapon.",
		"  No, never mind that!",
		"  It was too crazy to contemplate... but had he stayed behind... for her?",
		"\"Shizuki!\"",
		"  Aoko stopped the feet she had sworn to herself she would never stop moving and extended a hand out to him.",
		"\"That's enough! Leave it! We have to go!\"",
		"  Soujuurou tossed the fire extinguisher aside and took off running.",
		"  Pieces of ceiling continued to collapse like dominos.",
		"  They kept moving with dust and dirt following in their wake.",
		"  Their shadows raced through the collapsing corridor with all their strength.",
		"  ...The castle was in the throes of death.",
		"  With a massive crash and a cloud of dust, the final chapter of the fairy tale that had been Kitsy Land came to an abrupt end.",
		"  This duel to the death was over.",
		"  For a moment, amidst their swirling emotions, all past enmity was left behind and the two collapsed on the lawn and basked in a strange solidarity.",
		"  The ringing in their ears subsided before long.",
		"  A tremor of such magnitude seemed impossible in an amusement park like this.",
		"  As the sounds of destruction echoed across the park, Aoko addressed the individual at her side.",
		"\"Hey... You alive?\"",
		"\"Yeah.\"",
		"\"Tch.\"",
		"  While the click of her tongue was adorable, the meaning behind it was anything but.",
		"\"...Aozaki? What happened to that thing?\"",
		"\"What do you think? It was crushed to bits.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou sighed, not wholly relieved by her frank response. His reason...",
		"\"Never mind that thing. You should be worrying about yourself.\"",
		"  He wasn't out of the woods yet, after all.",
		"\"...Aozaki, I'm guessing you were a bit of a bully as a kid.\"",
		"\"Maybe, but I don't get a kick out of seeing people suffer.",
		"  Never mind that. Do you know the situation you're in right now?\"",
		"  She sat up and smiled.",
		"  Soujuurou hung his head in shame, wondering why her kind tone and expression were so chilling.",
		"\"Please accept my sincerest apologies.\"",
		"\"Oh no, don't you even start. You know what our agreement was, and a deal is a deal. If you held up your end of the bargain, I'd let you go.\"",
		"\"Exactly. And that's why I'm apologizing.\"",
		"  Soujuurou made a show of avoiding her eyes,",
		"  like a pouting child.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Aoko was taken aback by this sulky display.",
		"  Perhaps...",
		"He was angry at himself rather than her.",
		"  He was not mad because she would not let him go. He was mad that he had not done his part.",
		"\"...Haaah.\"",
		"  Aoko sighed for what seemed like the millionth time that day.",
		"  She could not figure out what surprised her more: his unconditional kindness, or her naïve approval of it.",
		"\"So, are you ready?\"",
		"\"Of course not, but a promise is a promise. In the end, I failed to do my part.\"",
		"  It was certainly the case that he failed to do any of the things she had expected of him.",
		"  But just then, she glanced back at the collapsed house of mirrors.",
		"  What had he done after failing so spectacularly?",
		"  He had searched for the extinguisher so he could use it as a weapon,",
		"  and waited patiently in the plaza as the maze collapsed all around him, because he thought it was wrong of him to leave alone.",
		"  It was a foolish choice, and the exact opposite of her choice to run towards the exit without hesitation.",
		"(I suppose I'll take it.)",
		"  She was satisfied, even as she was shocked at how naive she was being.",
		"  It was true that he had saved her.",
		"  She smiled inwardly, admiring―if only for a moment―the bravery he continued to show in the face of such extreme circumstances.",
		"\"You may have blown your chance, but you did make up for it after the fact. I'll keep my promise.\"",
		"  With a nod, she pulled herself to her feet.",
		"\"But you'll pay back this favor, someday.\"",
		"\"...?\"",
		"  The girl tried to keep a straight face as she offered a hand to the boy still lying on the ground.",
		"\"You managed to help me in the end.",
		"So, because of that, I'll let you off the hook. For tonight.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  She bashfully averted her gaze.",
		"  Though her profile appeared different than it had in the past, it was clearly still the face of the vibrant girl he met the day he first arrived in town.",
		"\"What are you staring at!?\"",
		"  As if she had felt his eyes on her, she shot him a frowning glare.",
		"\"Oh, sorry. It's just, as crazy as it is to say it aloud, you really are a fair person, Aozaki.\"",
		"  He took her outstretched hand.",
		"  Feeling his weight as she pulled him up, she could not help but think that he was about the last person she wanted to hear that from.",
		"\"By the way, you said you'd let me off the hook for tonight. What about tomorrow?\"",
		"\"Well, we'll just have to see.\"",
		"  She shrugged her shoulders as if she was not sure herself.",
		"  The response was so unlike her that it made Soujuurou smile.",
		"  Was it the solidarity of having escaped death together, or their fleeting camaraderie that made him do so?",
		"  It might have been for this night only, but the air between them was kind and gentle.",
		"  A lot had transpired, but the midwinter nightmare had come to an end.",
		"  The pair had overcome many trials and tribulations and could now leave the mirror realm in their wake.",
		"  But before that...",
		"\"...How selfish of you.",
		"  And who, may I ask, said you could decide that, Aoko?\"",
		"  It was the voice of a beautiful singing bird",
		"  and a merciless machine, all rolled into one.",
		"\"...Alice.\"",
		"  Her voice quivered as she spoke the name.",
		"  The lady in black made her presence known.",
		"  The night was not yet over.",
		"  Her name was Alice Kuonji.",
		"  She was a witch whose name struck fear into the heart of Aoko,",
		" an avatar of the night who would allow no witnesses.",
		"\"I guess that's it.\"",
		"  The central plaza was as silent as a grave. According to the map, the meeting spot was west of here.",
		"  Waiting for Soujuurou at his destination was a rugged, imposing, magnificent castle towering before the backdrop of the cloudy night sky.",
		"  Even for an abandoned park, it was a remarkable structure.",
		"  If the roller coasters and the Ferris wheel were loud, intense attractions, this was in comparison quiet and easygoing.",
		"  It was one of Kitsy Land's three iconic structures, and, in a way, the wicked fortress that guided this paradise down the path of closure.",
		"  Generally speaking, amusement park mazes generally fell into one of two categories.",
		"  A labyrinth, which disorients its visitors with its sheer size.",
		"  And a house of mirrors, which disorients visitors with optical illusions.",
		"  Many of a labyrinth's guests enjoyed the brief sense of adventure that it afforded.",
		"  Over the years, however, it would be usurped by the ever-increasing thrills of new attractions. Such is the way of all trends; the curse of fads.",
		"  The new must give way to the newer.",
		"  On the other hand, the house of mirrors was a time-honored, beloved staple.",
		"  Even within the confines of a classroom's dimensions, well-placed mirrors and well-directed light could both perplex and delight its visitors.",
		"  And figuring in the cost of maintenance, a well-designed house of mirrors could far outlive its labyrinth brethren.",
		"  Even if both types faded into obscurity, they would remain a staple of what constituted an amusement park.",
		"  However...",
		"  That didn't mean that combining them would produce double the fun.",
		"  Together, they transformed from entertainment into an uncanny realm from which those who dared to step within could never leave.",
		"  In a similar sense,",
		"  Kitsy's Mystery Tour Castle was the park's very own otherworld.",
		"  Indeed, five percent of visitors  ended up requesting staff assistance to get out.",
		"  Modeled after European castles, it was over one hundred meter in length, and the interior was further split into three floors.",
		"  Two floors above ground and one below, lined with mirrors from top to bottom, equal parts complex and vast. The maze demanded at least thirty minutes even from veterans.",
		"  One visit was all it took to be struck by catoptrophobia for hours. It was this labyrinth that now stood in Soujuurou's way. ",
		"\"It looks like it's not entirely pitch black... I guess somebody turned the lights on.\"",
		"  It seemed that Soujuurou, unaware of what a house of mirrors even was, concerned himself only with its lighting.",
		"  He checked the letter from Aoko once more.",
		"  The letter read, \"I will be waiting in the first floor lobby of the house of mirrors.\"",
		"  That meeting place was definitely in here.",
		"  There was something to see by at least, as he could just make out light faintly through the open doors.",
		"  Putting aside his suspicions, he headed toward the entrance.",
		"  ...The sound of his steps against the brick-laid path echoed faintly.",
		"  He was far from the hustle and bustle of the city.",
		"  The park's clocks no longer made tick nor tock,",
		"  and the winter's bite no longer blew in the night.",
		"  From within the silence, the stillness that would cause any onlooker to hold their breath...",
		"\"...Hello?\"",
		"  Soujuurou stopped abruptly at the entrance to the house of mirrors.",
		"\"By the way, why are you over there, Aozaki?\"",
		"  He called out, turning back toward the plaza.",
		"\"?!\"",
		"  A sound rang out, as if someone had dove behind a garbage can and it fell to the ground in their haste.",
		"  ...A short silence ensued.",
		"  For a moment, the abandoned park returned to its previous hush.",
		"  Resigned to her having been exposed, the girl appeared from her hiding place.",
		"\"Ao―\"",
		"  His voice died in his throat as he took in the sight of the girl's familiar face in unfamiliar attire.",
		"  This Aoko, with her long hair flowing in the breeze, was different from the Aoko that Soujuurou knew.",
		"  The resolute stance and posture she took exuded the strength of her will.",
		"  She stared directly at him with a sharp-eyed, piercing gaze.",
		"  Her eyes were glowing with a dim phosphoric light, enough to give Soujuurou pause that he might be hallucinating.",
		"  An icy coldness and a girl's strength.",
		"  Soujuurou lacked a sense of danger, but the sense of imbalance caused even him to feel the malice in the air.",
		"  It was as though the yuki-onna spirit of folklore had climbed out from a ghost story and appeared here in reality.",
		"\"...Aozaki?\"",
		"  Instinctively, Soujuurou took a step back.",
		"  Surprised, he was starting to feel concerned.",
		"  An unpleasant premonition rose to the surface, bringing with it a sense of anxiety. In spite of this, he felt obliged to honor urban etiquette by seeing if she was all right.",
		"\"...Did something happen to you? From the looks of it, I, um...\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Without acknowledging him, Aoko took a step forward.",
		"  Her figure, this atmosphere... Soujuurou found himself recalling a recent memory.",
		"  His twisted and knotted apprehension melted away and was replaced with a growing realization.",
		"  The girl before him was very similar to someone he had seen before, that night in the park, though he had only seen her from behind.",
		"  With increasing certainty causing him to swallow nervously, he noted that they... might as well have been identical.",
		"\"You asked me what I was doing. Well, it's exactly what it looks like.",
		"  I was waiting for my prey to pass by. Once you went inside, I was going to follow and cut off your only route of escape.\"",
		"  Aoko said, perturbed by the swift change in plans.",
		"(Phew, so I came to the right place.)",
		"  Soujuurou was mightily relieved he had not got the wrong place.",
		"  It was unclear whether he felt confident about dealing with what was to come, or if he had simply failed to grasp the hopelessness of the situation.",
		"  Aoko ignored his obtuse response and continued.",
		"\"You know, Shizuki.",
		"  Just like anyone else, some people get on my nerves and some people I just really hate.",
		"  But the funny thing is, my enemies are never people on my shit list.\"",
		"  Cold emotion burned in her eyes.",
		"  Her feet had already moved one step closer to Soujuurou.",
		"  Soujuurou's sense of foreboding was growing stronger. Wondering if what he sensed was bloodlust, he retreated another step.",
		"  Continuing as so, they maintained a distance of just five meters.",
		"\"As far as I can recall, I've never thought of someone I didn't like as an enemy.",
		"  As it happens, I've even had enemies that I liked.",
		"  And the reason is simple...\"",
		"  She held her right arm out.",
		"  The light about her was no illusion.",
		"\"It's simple, really.",
		"  Anyone who throws me out of whack is my enemy.\"",
		"  Her arm moved again.",
		"  It was instantaneous.",
		"  Something shot past Soujuurou in the blink of an eye, missing him by just twenty centimetres to his left.",
		"\"H-Hey...\"",
		"  Before his eyes, a blue light, something akin to a fireball, had ignited from nothing. He finally understood what was happening.",
		"\"Wait a second, I've seen one of those before!\"",
		"  She ignored his dimwitted reaction.",
		"\"Damn it. I missed.\"",
		"  Aoko muttered to herself.",
		"  The fist-sized hole the blue light had made in the house of mirrors crackled and smoldered.",
		"  A shot like that could easily cave in a human skull in addition to burning it to a crisp.",
		"\"...Hah. I'd have to kill myself if Alice saw me miss at this range.",
		"  But you get it now, right? This is it for you. There won't be a second chance.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou backed away swiftly.",
		"  Things were beyond incomprehensible. He was close to losing the ability to think at all.",
		"  All he could make out was the figure of the dependable student council president―or at least what he had thought was the president―and the memories of the park that night two days ago.",
		"  He had never experienced anything like this, though most people living in a civilized country would have never seen anything like it either.",
		"  A lethal weapon that could kill with nothing more than the pull of a finger had a way of suspending the ability of its target to determine between not just good and evil, but dreams and reality, past and future.",
		"  And the more peaceful someone's life had been, the stronger that suspension was likely to be.",
		"  All that one could think about was the fact that they were alive at that very moment.",
		"  It was as if he was an unwritten character on a blank piece of white paper.",
		"  There was no before, there was no after, there was only what came next.",
		"  This was a very common thought process for anyone staring down the barrel of a gun.",
		"\"Oh, don't bother begging. It's pointless.",
		"  But feel free to air your grievances. It's a killer's duty to listen to her victim's last words.\"",
		"  By saying it was pointless, she made it sound more like she would not listen to what he had to say.",
		"  However, Soujuurou was in such a state of shock that it did not even enter his mind to speak up.",
		"  All he knew, for reasons unknown, was that the girl in front of him wanted him dead.",
		"(Y-You could have told me, Tobimaru!",
		"  You said that no such thing exists!",
		"  Well how about now, idiot? There's a monster right in front of me!)",
		"  Soujuurou felt that if he had said that aloud, the second blast would come even quicker than the last, so he kept it to himself.",
		"  His mental expletives stirred his mind from paralysis to mere panic.",
		"  This response came not from confidence, however.",
		"\"Someday, out of the blue, someone is going to kill me.\"",
		"  While it may have seemed like a baseless belief to hold-",
		"(Oh, but now that I think about it, murders happen all the time in cities.",
		"  I should have remembered: you break the rules, you get killed! It's clear to me now!)",
		"  To Soujuurou, the situation seemed to perfectly align with his inexperienced understanding that the city was a coldly pragmatic place.",
		"  As far as he was concerned in this moment, being killed by a classmate was not something to be so surprised by.",
		"  In a society where murder was possible, he was able to accept this sort of situation as natural. Of virtually no concern was the series of events that led to Aoko's aggression towards him, ",
		"  The only thing that truly confused him was Aoko's blue fireball.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou swallowed with an audible gulp.",
		"  To anyone who may have been watching, it was the response of a victim paralyzed by fear.",
		"\"That's right. So you do finally get it.",
		"  I'm all out of words, so I think it's time you died.",
		"  I could go on about how magecraft has to stay hidden, but that doesn't really have anything to do with you. All you need to know is that you were in the wrong place at the wrong time. And that it was me who killed you.\"",
		"  Done talking, Aoko once again lifted her right arm.",
		"  There was a hum like a machine.",
		"  Blue light began to revolve about her arm beneath her sleeve.",
		"  This was taking longer than last time, leading Soujuurou to believe that it was going to be much stronger than the attack that was still scorching the wall behind him. The realization caused his panic to heighten.",
		"(No, wait, it's not about me having to die, or the fact that the monster that night was actually Aozaki, or even whether she's a part of the church... It's not about any of that.)",
		"  His thoughts became jumbled.",
		"  His heart pounded like a hammer.",
		"  ...This was no time to be standing still.",
		"  He was not sure if the girl in front of him was really human.",
		"  And more importantly, even if he could accept the events unfolding before him, when all was said and done...",
		"\"Wait! It's wrong to kill people!\"",
		"  Even if it was a fact of life in the city, Soujuurou was not about to lie down and die!",
		"\"Don't you think I know that?!\"",
		"\"Just... W-Waaait!\"",
		"  Soujuurou's scream, still entirely oblivious, was just the thing to invoke Aoko's full wrath.",
		"\"AaaHhhaaah!?\"",
		"  Aoko fired a barrage of blue magical bullets.",
		"  In an instant, Soujuurou dashed into the shadows behind him, into the entrance to the house of mirrors.",
		"\"Wh-Wh-What the heck was that?!\"",
		"  He darted feverishly down the hall.",
		"  After a mere two meters, he was left completely out of breath. This was due to his shock at seeing yet another attack, fiercer than the first, that he'd never seen in his life, and because he couldn't shake the thought that if he had moved even a second later, he would be dead.",
		"  He could not afford to stop.",
		"  The sound of merciless footsteps closed in behind him.",
		"\"I've bought myself some time. Maybe here I'll be able to figure out something...\"",
		"  He threw everything into his legs as he sprinted.",
		"  A straight, narrow passage about 20 meters long connected the entrance to the main lobby.",
		"  At this rate, if he could just make it to the lobby, he was sure he would be able to find as many hiding spots as he needed.",
		"(Thank god!)",
		"  He arrived in a large, open space.",
		"  This was the first floor lobby. There were three passageways.",
		"  One led to the basement floor.",
		"  One connected to the first floor maze.",
		"  The other was a set of stairs leading to the second floor.",
		"  Soujuurou did not particularly care which one he chose, so, trusting his intuition, he made a run for the first floor maze, when...",
		"\"Ouch!\"",
		"  He smacked his head into a transparent wall.",
		"\"A...mirror?!\"",
		"\"That's right. It's annoying, but I guess this makes things fair.",
		"  The chaser and the chased are on equal ground.\"",
		"  A somehow-cheerful voice echoed in his direction.",
		"  There was no need for Soujuurou to even turn around.",
		"  In the very same mirror he had crashed into he could see Aoko Aozaki's figure slowly approaching.",
		"\"You should know, I sealed off the first floor exit deeper inside. Physically, not with a Bounded Field.",
		"  Is calling it a seal going too far? Maybe plugged or buried works. Either way, if you get too close, you'll be swallowed by a cave-in. I recommend keeping your distance if you don't want to be buried alive.\"",
		"\"-, -!\"",
		"  Panicked by the impending footsteps, Soujuurou groped for the wall.",
		"  He could see the stairs to the second floor.",
		"  He did not understand what Aoko had meant earlier, but he at least knew that the first floor was not going to save him.",
		"\"It would save me a lot of trouble if you just died that way, though.",
		"  The cleanup is much easier for accidental deaths.\"",
		"\"...!\"",
		"  Behind him was a creature beyond words.",
		"  As she continued her idle taunting, she lifted her right arm ostentatiously.",
		"  Even from above her clothes one could see some kind of strange, incongruous pattern upon her body.",
		"  The veins beneath her skin...",
		"  They made it seem as though something inhuman was circulating her body.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Whether out of pity or repulsion,",
		"  Soujuurou stopped for just a moment.",
		"  His pursuer evaded his gaze.",
		"\"You've noticed, then. I normally hide it with ointment, but today is special.",
		"  It's called a Magical Crest. It's proof that I'm a mage.",
		"  You see this light revolving around me, right? It's the beginning of what formed that Snap―those bullets.",
		"  I'm feeling pretty good today, and I've never felt more confident in how to use my magical energy efficiently. I think I'm good for another thirty bullets or so.\"",
		"  Perhaps she was on an emotional high, for her voice had become frightfully friendly.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  The substance of the conversation could not have been any more unsettling, however.",
		"\"...I don't understand a thing you're saying, Aozaki.\"",
		"\"You don't? I'm telling you that I have thirty more shots in the tank.",
		"  If you can escape before I use them up, it's your win. For today, that is.\"",
		"(...For today? You mean I have to do this tomorrow, too?)",
		"  Soujuurou knit his brows.",
		"  Aoko's expression creased into a scowl at his behavior. Although he was panicking, it seemed that deep down he still did not feel the full weight of the crisis.",
		"  She knew he still didn't get it.",
		"\"I said my piece. Free time is over.",
		"  I may still have some trash talk left in me, but, well, there's never enough time to get it all off my chest, anyway. Just give up already.\"",
		"  It appeared Aoko had prepared this theatrical dialogue ahead of time.",
		"  Not to allow her opponent time for futile pleading, but to give him the time to curse her, his killer.",
		"  Such forthrightness was her modus operandi. With this victim, however, it was not going as she had hoped.",
		"\"Anyway, that's all I have to say.",
		"  Shall we begin the hunt?\"",
		"  Her voice was void of emotion, and her eyes ruthless as they bored into her prey.",
		"  This time, Soujuurou finally accepted that he was going to die."
