		"　遊園地と言っても所詮はキッツィーランド。",
		"　高校生が全力で走れば二十分ほどで一周できる。",
		"　そんな地域密着型のアミューズメントパークは、しかし。",
		"「――――――」",
		"「――――――」",
		"　……このように。",
		"　住人ばかりか、遊園地そのものを変化させていた。",
		"「……蒼崎」",
		"「……なによ」",
		"「……言いたくないんだけど。この遊園地、広くなってないか？」",
		"　そう。",
		"出口を間違えたとか、地形が変わっているとか、そんな現実的な間違いではない。",
		"　あらゆるものが、ねじ曲がっている。",
		"　遊園地はそれ自体が生き物のように、いまもって、その規模を成長させていた。",
		"「―――」",
		"　気が付けば包囲網は一段と強固になっている。",
		"　草十郎に背中をあずけながら、青子は懸命に泣き言を抑えこむ。",
		"　草十郎は驚き、怖がるだけでいい。",
		"　けれど青子はそうはいかない。",
		"　この状況を招き、彼の手を取った責任がある。",
		"　おいそれとパニックに<陥|おちい>るワケにはいかないのだ。",
		"“……大丈夫、落ち着け私……",
		"　遊園地の果てはある。遠いけど、鉄柵はちゃんと見える。",
		"　フラットスナークだって制限無しってワケじゃない。外に逃げるって選択は正しいはず……。",
		"　現状、外までは目算で一キロぐらいだけど―――”",
		"　ここまで夢中で走りすぎた。",
		"　青子も草十郎も息が上がっている。",
		"　あと一キロ走るのなら、いったん休憩をいれないと途中で足が止まってしまう。",

		"「へ？」",
		"　背中ごしに<囁|ささや>きかけられ、青子は現実に引き戻された。",

		"「……賛成。ここから休みなしで外周まで走るのは、やめた方がいい」",
		"「―――驚いた。静希君も外まで走ろう派とは」",
		"　言って、くすりと笑ってしまった。",
		"　背中の戦友はパニック状態どころか、きちんと現状と、その打開策を考えていた。",
		"「ちょっとだけ建物に逃げこむのは？」",
		"「………気は進まないけど、それしかないわね」",
		"　焼きたてパンたちの包囲網。",
		"　常人ならいざ知らず、青子ならこの囲みを破って建物に逃げこむのは<容易|ようい>だ。",
		"　問題は―――",
		"“……問題は、どんな店を選ぶかってコト―――”",
		"　変貌する遊園地の特性を考慮する。",
		"　何が危険で、何が安全なのか。",
		"　大事なのは建物の強度や複雑さではなく―――",
		"“そうだ、選ぶなら<あ|・><の|・><単|・><純|・><さ|・>で正しいはず……！”",
		"「静希君、あっち！」",
		"　怪物たちを蹴散らしてカウンターに飛びこむ青子と、その後に続く草十郎。",
		"「カウンターに隠れてて！」",
		"　青子は西部劇の銃撃戦のように、カウンターを盾にして怪物たちと対峙する。",
		"「ビンゴ……！　ここならスナーク化しないんだ！」",
		"　敵の様子を確認し、青子もカウンター内部に腰を下ろした。",
		"「アイツらは……？」",
		"「店の周りで<地団駄|じだんだ>踏んでるわ。理由があってね、アイツらはここには入ってこられないのよ」",
		"「？？」",
		"　不思議がる草十郎にまあまあと笑いかけて、青子は大きく胸を上下させた。",
		"　安堵と、おそらくは疲労からきた大きな息継ぎ。",
		"「とりあえずコーヒーブレイクね。ここは遊園地の中でも遊びのない場所だから、アイツらにとっては鬼門なのよ。",
		"　レジスターも調理道具も最近のものだし、擬人化されたマスコットもないし。スナーク化するには、ちょい文明圏すぎるってコト」",
		"「すなーく？」",
		"「アイツらの名前よ。つけたのは私じゃなくて有珠……なのかしらね。あの子の性格的にちょっと想像できないけど、まあ、とにかくそういう名前」",
		"　安全と分かって落ち着いたのか、草十郎は興味津々とばかりに耳を傾ける。",
		"　なるほど、なんてしかつめらしく頷いているが、きっと分かってないだろうなー、と青子はつい笑ってしまった。",
		"　普段ならイラっとくるところだが、今は彼の妙な真面目さがありがたく、あたたかい。",
		"「それはともかく。調子良さそうだな、蒼崎」",
		"　そんな青子の笑みを余裕と勘違いして、草十郎も顔をほころばす。",
		"　誤解の連鎖だが、今はそれを<糾|ただ>すこともない。",
		"「あれ、貴方から見ても分かる？",
		"　私の魔弾の威力が上がっているの」",
		"「そりゃあ、ミラーハウスでさんざん追いかけ回されたからな。あの時と同じ動作なのに物騒さが増していれば、イヤでも分かる」",
		"「でもいいのか？　たしか、数にかぎりがあるとか言ってただろ。もうずいぶん撃っちまったけど。二十、三十じゃきかないぞ」",
		"「―――アンタ、時々、アレよね」",
		"「？」",
		"　不覚にも、ちょっと見直す青子だった。",
		"「なんでもない。",
		"　私の魔弾の威力が上がっているのは、単純に魔力の濃度の問題。さっきから霧がかかってるでしょ？　あれ、全部魔力なのよ。<魔|タ><弾|マ>を撃つための燃料と思って」",
		"　魔力とは大きく二種類あり、",
		"　魔術師が肉体から生成する<小源|オド>と、",
		"　大気に満ちている<大源|マナ>とがある。",
		"　この遊園地はいま、マナに満ちあふれた御伽の国だ。",
		"　一般人にとっては何の効果もないが、魔術師にとっては術式を使いたい放題の楽園と化している。",
		"「じゃあ残り魔力とやらは気にしなくていいのか。",
		"　注意すべきは怪我と体力だけ？」",
		"「……まあ、個人的な責任においてはそのかぎりね」",
		"　良かった、と息をつく草十郎。",
		"　草十郎から見れば、青子は怪物たちをなぎ払う遊園地最強の暴れん坊だ。",
		"　不安なのは魔力が尽きる事だったが、それがないのであればまさに百人力である。",
		"「頼りにしてくれるのは嬉しいけど、ぬか喜びよ。",
		"あんな雑魚たち、ただ動いているだけのガラクタなんだから。",
		"　スナーク本体は当然として、有珠が<他|・><の|・><童|・><話|・><の|・><怪|・><物|・>を出してきたら私じゃどうにもならない」",
		"「他の童話の怪物？　……遊園地をこんなふうに変えたヤツ以外に、まだいるのか？」",
		"「そ。プロイキッシャーって名付けられた、<魔術師|わたしたち>でさえ目を背けたくなる反則。",
		"不可能な夢物語をも再現する、時代に取り残されたデタラメよ」",
		"「？？」",
		"　自分の事は棚にあげて？　と言いたげな顔である。",
		"「あのね、私たちはちゃんと現代によりそった魔術師よ。",
		"　できない事もあるし、当たり前の事だけど、近代兵器には敵わない。二十世紀―――ま、色んな戦争の後押しで、兵器の進化は私たちを越えちゃったから」",
		"「……けどあの子のは違う。どんなに人間の技術が進歩しようと関係ないって怪物なの。",
		"　たとえば、あのブレッドマンいるでしょ？",
		"　あいつには自動拳銃とかきかないわよ。たぶん、意味が分かっていないから」",
		"　ひょい、とカウンターから外を指す青子。",
		"「有珠の使い魔は全てが空想によってこねられた神秘なの。",
		"　前提からしてあり得ない事だから、通常の物理法則と折り合いが悪い。空想と現実は両立しないっていう、ごく当たり前の理由でね」",
		"「……なるほど。ブレッドマンってのは、あの動く焼きたてパンの事なんだな」",
		"　青子の説明の大部分をスルーして、気になるコトだけ拾う草十郎だった。",
		"「…………話を戻すけど。",
		"　あいつらと近代兵器の相性は最悪。ロケット弾でも効果はないわ。意思の疎通、秩序の共有ができてないから」",
		"「<童話の怪物|プロイキッシャー>にとって、彼らの世界には存在しないもの、意味が分からないモノは、触れるコトなく霧散する。",
		"　彼らに<通|つう>じるのは同じ神秘を帯びた“魔力”だけっていうデタラメぶりよ。もう完全に<概念|がいねん>空間っていうか、概念宇宙っていうか―――」",
		"「――――――」",
		"「…………こほん。",
		"　要するに、アイツらは伝承防御っていう特別なルールを持っていて、単純に強い力、強い魔術じゃ効果は薄いの。元になった童話にちなんだ欠点をつかないと倒せない。",
		"　ギリシャ神話のアキレスあたり分かりやすい喩えなんだけど……知ってる？」",
		"　草十郎はぶんぶんと首を振る。",
		"「そ。無事帰れたら、鳶丸あたりに教えてもらって。",
		"　定番だけどいい<教訓|はなし>よ、アレ」",
		"　……かなりおいてけぼり感ただよう草十郎だが、彼は彼なりに現状把握に努めてみた。",
		"“<童話の怪物|プロイキッシャー>”とやらは、青子やミラーハウスの自動人形ですら<裸足|はだし>で逃げだすモノだという。",
		"　たしかに目の前の光景は誰かの悪夢の中に迷いこんだとしか思えない。",
		"　だがしかし、と草十郎は思うのだ。",
		"「やっぱり、蒼崎の方が怖くないか？」",
		"「アンタ死ぬの？」",
		"　ほら、と無言の抗議をする草十郎。",
		"「……あのね。いま私たちを取り囲んでるのはオマケにすぎないの。",
		"　有珠にとって、あのブレッドマンもロブスターもソーセージ屋のミンチマシーンも、全部が全部、私が撃ってる魔弾より価値がない。",
		"　いい？　あの動くマスコットたちはね、<た|・><だ|・><の|・><オ|・><マ|・><ケ|・>なの。有珠が解放した“童話の怪物”の、一呼吸みたいなものなのよ」",
		"「―――呼吸って、これが？」",
		"「……私だって考えたくないわよ。",
		"　でもそれが現状。たった一体の“童話の怪物”だけで私たちは手一杯。",
		"そういう訳だから、有珠があと一体でも追加したら諦めて」",
		"「追加って……これに制限はないのか？」",
		"「あの子が出し惜しみしなければ、まだ何体かストックはあるでしょうけど……ま、成立する条件はあるわね。",
		"　たとえば川がないと目を覚まさない怪物もいる。この遊園地、噴水はあるけど川はないでしょ？　元になった童話しばりなの、あの子の使い魔は」",
		"「童話って、かけそばとか？」",
		"「<遊園地|ここ>に川がないのは不幸中の幸いね。もしあったら、もっと直接制圧に向いた奴が出てきてた」",
		"　草十郎の合いの手をサラッと無視する青子だった。",
		"「―――話の続きだけど。",
		"　有珠の魔術の基本はマザーグース……",
		"って知らないか。イギリスの唄で、遊び心にとんだ、メルヘンチックな内容よ。",
		"　ただ、そっち系のプロイキッシャーは怖くないの。",
		"みんなそれなりに、なんとか魔術にも落としこめる範囲だから」",
		"「……聞きたくないんだけど、そっち系じゃないのは？」",
		"「マザーグースを下地にした、とある創作童話系。",
		"　……<有珠|あの子>のお母さんが好きでね、<こ|・><っ|・><ち|・><系|・>のはドイツもコイツも尋常じゃない。<魔術師|わたしたち>から見ても勘弁してって言いたくなるわ」",
		"「で、この遊園地を生き返らせたのは<こ|・><っ|・><ち|・><系|・>よ。",
		"　たぶんフラットスナークってヤツだと思う。……私も聞き流していたから、詳しくは分からないけど」",
		"「――――――」",
		"　のど元まで出た不満を飲みこむ。",
		"　こっち系とかそっち系とか曖昧な言い方はやめてほしい草十郎だったが、今の台詞には、他に追及すべき事があったからだ。",
		"「待て蒼崎。あの子の話を聞き流したって、なんで」",
		"「いやぁ、説明してもらったのは随分と前だし……あの頃は有珠の話、あんまり信じられなかったのよね。",
		"　私が素人だと思って大げさに自分の魔術を語ってくれてるなあ、舐められてるなあ、とか。あはは」",
		"　無論、舐めていたのは青子の方だった。",
		"　有珠を守る怪物が「本物」だと青子が経験するのは、二人が出会ってからしばらくしての事だ。",
		"　マインスターの魔女が魔術世界においてどれほど異端なのか、青子は身をもって経験する事になる。",
		"「……その聞き流した内容は？」",
		"「なんでも強力な結界を張るプロイだって。",
		"有珠が受け継いだ<玩具|プロイ>は山ほどあるけど、その中でも<選|え>りすぐりの一つよ。",
		"　<棄|す>てられたモノ、忘れられたモノを童話的に蘇らせるヤツで、今まで誰も破ったコトがないとか。",
		"　それで、ついたあだ名が“<触|ふ>れられぬもの”」",
		"「？　ふらっとすなーく、じゃないのか？」",
		"「それもあだ名。とにかく正体が分からないヤツばっかりなんで、一つの個体に複数の名前がつけられるの。",
		"　フラットスナークはその中でも、正体不明さはトップランクのデタラメぶりよ。",
		"　―――貴方、ルイス・キャロルの『スナーク狩り』って本、知ってる？」",
		"「いや。そもそもルイスキャロルというのは？」",
		"「……そっからかあ……えーと、ドジスン教授は、そうね。特殊性癖を持った妄想紳士ってトコ？　ま、こっちは別にどうでもいいか。人によっては時間の無駄だろうし」",
		"「いま重要なのは、彼が残した著作の方。",
		"　『スナーク狩り』はね、スナークって呼ばれる正体不明の怪物を捕まえようと奔走する冒険家たちの話なの」",
		"「キャロルらしい、皮肉ばっちり、支離滅裂、意味不明、結末不在のホントに困った本で、一行は島で苦しみつつ、最終的にはスナークを見つけるものの、見つけた<主人公|ベイカー>は唐突に姿を消して終わってしまう。",
		"“よく分からないもの”探しに奔走する人間の風刺なんだけど―――この遊園地において、誰が<主人公|ベイカー>で、何が<怪物|スナーク>かは言うまでもないでしょ？」",
		"　青子は語らないが、フラットスナークには他にも俗称がある。",
		"　不可解の島、五次元平面。",
		"　こちらは有珠が口にしたものではなく、かつてマインスターに破れた魔術師たちのうわごとだ。",
		"　数学において、スナークとはグラフ理論で用いられる、矛盾した、決してあり得ないある平面グラフを指す。",
		"　この世に『無い』と立証されながらも名を与えられた平面。逆説のみで構成された不遇の存在。",
		"　その名を冠した“童話の怪物”は、誰にも正体を明かす事がないという。",
		"　……そして、青子は語らない。",
		"　フラットスナークは成長する“童話の怪物”だ。",
		"　どこかに隠れている本体は、こうしている今も遊園地を完全な御伽の国に変えようと、<魔|い><力|き>を吐き続けている事を。",
		"「……ま、<脅|おど>かしてもしょうがないし」",
		"「なにか言ったか？」",
		"「別に。簡単に言って、『童話世界の再生』がフラットスナークの力なの。",
		"　この遊園地との相性は抜群でしょうね。なにしろ、元々が童話を元にした遊び場だから」",
		"　……仮にオフィス街であったのなら、フラットスナークもここまでの脅威は持たなかっただろう。",
		"　せいぜいビルの窓硝子に恐竜の影絵を映す程度の力だ。",
		"「あ。だからここは安全だって―――",
		"ん？」",
		"　草十郎が“その異変”に気が付いたのは、背中にぴちょん、と<粘|ねば>つく液体が落ちたからだ。",
		"「あ、あ―――」",
		"　天井を見上げる。",
		"<ソ|・><レ|・>と目が合う。",
		"どうなっているのか考える前に、草十郎の腰は跳ね上がって―――",
		"「蒼崎、外だ！」",
		"　彼は<率先|そっせん>してカウンターから飛び出した。",
		"「バカ、何して―――」",
		"　自殺行為に等しい愚行を止めようと、つられて青子は腰を浮かす。",
		"　瞬間、頭上に何が生まれているのかに気が付いた。",
		"「！　って、ヤバ―――!?」",
		"「あ、危なかったぁ……！」",
		"　ばくん、と閉じられる巨大な口。",
		"　呼びこみマスコットのいないバーガーショップは、その店ごと怪物に変貌していた。",
		"「もうっ、なんで天井にピエロの絵なんて描いてんのよあの店！？",
		"　普通、もっと違うところに労力さかない！？　そんなにピエロが好きなら入り口にでも飾っとけ！」",
		"　罵倒しながら走る青子。",
		"　……もう安全な場所はどこにもない。",
		"　かろうじて残っていた文明圏すら、刻一刻と童話に侵食されていた。",
		"　遊園地のスナーク化は最終段階を迎えていた。",
		"　命を与えられたのはマスコットたちだけではない。",
		"　バーガーショップのように、建物すら生き物に変貌しようとしている。",
		"　遊園地を巡るコースターは<中華龍|チャイニーズドラゴン>よろしく、うねうねとのたうつ始末。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　呆然と、全長八十メートル近くまで膨張した観覧車を見上げる青子と草十郎。",
		"　そんなふたりにチケットを配るように、大量のブレッドマンが襲いかかる。",
		"「このっ、列整理は間に合ってるっての！」",
		"　わらわらと大挙するオブジェ。",
		"　包囲網は破っても破っても形成される。",
		"　絶え間ない物量作戦。",
		"さもありなん、資源の<枯渇|こかつ>で悩むおとぎ<噺|ばなし>は<滅多|めった>にない……！",
		"「っ、なんかどうしようもないぞ！",
		"　コイツら、増える一方だ！」",
		"「スナーク本体を探して！",
		"　童話の怪物には本体にあたる器物があるの！　それさえ壊せば遊園地から出られるはず！」",
		"「本体ってどんな!?」",
		"「さっき言ったでしょ、童話の怪物は現実に無いものだって！　今までいなかったおかしなヤツとか、現実じゃありえないモノ！　それが本体！」",
		"「おかしなヤツって、たとえば!?」",
		"「だから！",
		"　命のある人形とか、空飛ぶゴーカートとか―――」",
		"　魔弾を放つ青子の手が止まる。",
		"　口にして、自分たちがどれほど<窮|きわ>まっているかを思い知ったのだ。",
		"　遊園地は“童話の怪物”と思われるモノであふれている。",
		"　変形し、自ら動き出したオブジェたちはみな“現実にないモノ”なのだ。",
		"「……そっか。おかしくないヤツなんて、一つもないんだ」",
		"“この中に紛れこんでる……？”",
		"　青子は呟きながら、それはないな、と唇を噛んだ。",
		"　フラットスナークは結界を張るタイプの<怪物|プロイ>だ。",
		"　これだけ大量の使い魔を統率している以上、本体の防御力は低いか、もしくは<皆無|かいむ>と見るべきだろう。",
		"　……加えて、“触れられぬもの”“正体不明”という物語を原型としているのなら、見抜かれたが最後、呆気なく崩壊するのが筋というもの。",
		"“……逆に言えば、見つければ私たちの勝ち。",
		"　そんな<脆|もろ>いヤツが雑魚に紛れこむ？　木の葉を隠すなら森の中って言うけど―――”",
		"　この通り。",
		"　流れ弾であっさり吹き飛ぶ可能性がある以上、青子たちの前には現れない。",
		"　スナーク本体はもっと安全な場所で、この遊園地を育てている。",
		"“……でもどこかに見えているはず。",
		"　スナークは本の主題だもの。<常|つね>に<視界|ページ>のどこかにいないと、主人公の資格がない―――！”",
		"　それはどこか。",
		"　安易に考えるなら、あの観覧車がもっとも安全、かつ遊園地を象徴する“主題”だが―――",
		"「あの子を捕まえるのは！？」",
		"　突然の提案に目を見張る。",
		"　青子が打開策を思案していたように、草十郎もまた、彼なりに頭を巡らせていたらしい。",
		"　草十郎の提案はシンプルだ。",
		"　スナークの本体が見つけられないのなら、その持ち主である有珠を倒せばいいのではないか。",
		"　有珠は時計台から動いていない。",
		"　ここからでも、月光に照らされる姿は目に入る。",
		"「それは一番ダメ！",
		"　有珠を殺してもフラットスナークは止まらないし、このトンデモが外にあふれだす事になる！",
		"　だいたい、私じゃあの子を殺せないから！　よくて半殺しがいいところ！」",
		"　主人の悪口にいきりたったブレッドマンが、こんがり無惨に焼け焦げになる。",
		"　……じり、と背中をあわせて呼吸を整えるふたり。",
		"　目の醒めるような打開策は出ず、いよいよもって八方ふさがりになった状況に消沈する。",
		"　一方。<獲物|えもの>の活きの良さが分かるのか、オブジェたちは輪になって青子たちを観察していた。",
		"　パン屋にひきずりこんで焼き殺すか、",
		"　精肉店の挽肉機ですり潰すか。",
		"　はたまた串刺しにしてゴーラウンドで引き回すか、",
		"　トゲトゲだらけの<海賊船|ゆりかご>に乗せて航海に乗りだすか。",
		"　二年間眠っていた分、歓迎意欲は盛りだくさんだ。",
		"「……いちおう、聞いておきたいんだけど」",
		"「なに。手短にね、いま考え事してるから」",
		"「ああ。……あの連中がなにをしたいか、イヤっていうほど伝わってくるんだけど。それって、あの子の趣味なのかな」",
		"「……その疑問はなかったわ。",
		"連中の人間嫌いは遊園地の怨念と、フラットスナークの性格じゃない？　基本的にマトモなヤツいないから、有珠の使い魔って。",
		"　ああ、でも―――」",
		"　なんというか、有珠の性格の怖さも否定できない青子だった。",
		"「それは結構。……それで、蒼崎の考えごとって？　止める方法、考えついたのか？」",
		"「期待させて悪いけどお手上げ。ま、アンタが殺されれば止まるでしょうけど」",
		"「それはイヤだ！　とりあえず逃げよう！」",
		"「え、ちょっ、静希君！？」",
		"　―――突然の<展|こ><開|と>に目を見張る。",
		"　今まで青子に付いてくるだけだった草十郎は強引に青子の手を取って、焼きたてパンの群に突進―――囲みを<破|やぶ>ろうと力任せに特攻する。",
		"「い、意味わかんなすぎ！",
		"　なんで今の流れでそうなるのよアンタはーーーー！？」",
		"　別人のようなアグレッシブさを発揮する草十郎を<罵|ののし>りながら、律儀にフォローする青子。",
		"　草十郎の体当たりでは包囲網を突破できない。",
		"　青子はすぐさま体勢をたてなおし、草十郎の正面に魔弾を掃射する。",
		"「っ、はっ―――！」",
		"　囲いを抜け、全力で走りだす。",
		"　こうなっては当初の予定通り、遊園地の外を目指すしかない。",
		"　……まあ、それはともかくとして。",
		"「なんでよ!?　さっきはあんなに諦め良かったのに！」",
		"　青子には草十郎の反応が、とにかくホントに理解不能。",
		"「ミラーハウスの時と今は違うだろ！　いいから走れ！」",
		"「違わないわよ！　アンタを殺そうとした私も、アンタを殺したい有珠も！　理由も結果も同じよ、私たち!?」",
		"　何でこんなコトで怒鳴っているんだろう、と思いながらも青子は止まらない。",
		"　きっと、無謀にもブレッドマンに突進した草十郎の馬鹿さ加減が頭にきているんだ、と自分自身に言い聞かせる。",
		"「あのね、一緒に逃げてるぐらいで勘違いしないでくれる!?　言っとくけど私、明日になったらまたアンタを殺しに行くから！　死にたくないってんなら、ここで私からも逃げだしたら!?」",
		"「それはまた今度の話だろ！　だいたい、蒼崎に殺されるのならいいけど、あの子に殺されるのはイヤだ！」",
		"「だからなんで！？」",
		"「だって顔も知らない！　話したコトさえない相手だ！」",
		"「―――は？」",
		"　沸き立っていた激情が、一瞬で鎮火する。",
		"　あまりに簡潔かつどうでもいい理由に、青子の<直情|いかり>はあっさりと消えてしまった。",
		"「顔も知らないって……」",
		"　草十郎としては、よく知った相手なら殺されてもいいのだろうか？",
		"　ますますもって理解できない、と顔をしかめながら、青子は草十郎の背中を追いかけるのだった。"

		"\"We'll take five here. This restaurant is the blandest place in the park, which makes it their Achilles' heel.",
		"  The registers and utensils are all modern, and there are no mascot characters. It's just a bit too civilized for Snark to mess with.\"",
		"\"Snark?\"",
		"\"That's their name, though Alice is the one who came up with it... I think. It doesn't really sound like her, but whatever. That's what they're called.\"",
		"  Perhaps now at ease from knowing they were safe, Soujuurou seemed enthralled in her explanation.",
		"  Aoko could not help but chuckle as Soujuurou nodded sagely. It was certain that he had no idea what she was talking about.",
		"  Normally this would have irritated her, but this time she was grateful for the warmth of his strange sobriety.",
		"\"It's good that you seem better, Aozaki.\"",
		"  Mistaking her smile for composure, Soujuurou broke into a smile himself.",
		"  It was just another link in a chain of misunderstandings, but there was no need to redress it.",
		"\"Oh, you can tell?",
		"  Yeah, my magic bullets are getting more powerful.\"",
		"\"Well, you did chase me all around that house of mirrors while firing those things at me, so I guess I've become really familiar with them, for better or worse.\"",
		"\"Are you sure you're okay, though? I remember you mentioning that you had a limited number of shots, but you've fired at least twenty or thirty so far, right?\"",
		"\"You know, every now and then, you...\"",
		"\"?\"",
		"  Her opinion of him improved, just a little bit.",
		"\"Never mind.",
		"  My bullets' increase in power is a simple matter of the density of their magical energy. You've seen that fog around the park from a bit ago, right? It's all just magical energy. Think of it as fuel for my bullets.\"",
		"  Magical energy was divided into two broad categories.",
		"  First was od, produced inside a mage's body.",
		"  Second was mana, which filled the atmosphere.",
		"  At the moment, the amusement park had turned into a fairy-tale land, overflowing with mana.",
		"  Although it meant nothing to the average person, to a mage it was a paradise where spells could be cast as much as one pleased.",
		"\"So that means you don't have to worry about how much magic-whatever you have left then.",
		"  All we need to worry about are injuries and stamina?\"",
		"\"...Well, as far as our own lives are concerned, yeah.\"",
		"  Soujuurou breathed a sigh of relief.",
		"  From Soujuurou's perspective, more so than the monsters she mowed down, Aoko was the biggest bully on the playground.",
		"  He had been concerned about what would happen should her magical energy be exhausted, but luckily for him she was far from surrendering her crown.",
		"\"It's nice that you trust me and all, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.",
		"Those minions out there are just walking garbage.",
		"  If Alice summons any other fairy-tale monsters, let alone the actual Snark making an appearance, there's nothing I'll be able to do.\"",
		"\"Other fairy-tale monsters? You mean there are others apart from the thing that changed the park?\"",
		"\"Yes. They're called Ploy Kickshaws, aberrations that even we mages can't stand to look at.",
		"They're nonsense lost to time, used to revive impossible fantasies.",
		"\"?\"",
		"  Soujuurou's expression seemed to be calling her out on the hypocrisy.",
		"\"Hey, most of us have modern standards, you know.",
		"  Obviously there are things we can't do, and we're no match for modern weapons. The twentieth century-well, a bunch of wars helped weapons technology catch up to us.\"",
		"\"...But that girl is a different beast altogether. Mankind's evolution can't hold a flame to her power.",
		"  Take those bread-men, for instance.",
		"  Something like a machine gun would have no effect on them, probably because guns make no sense to them.\"",
		"  Aoko casually gestured outside, past the counter.",
		"\"Alice's familiars are Mystics kneaded from fantasies.",
		"  They're all impossible in the first place, so they don't play nice with the laws of physics. That shouldn't come as a surprise, since fantasy and reality can't exist together.\"",
		"\"...I see. So they're literally walking loaves of bread.\"",
		"  Soujuurou seemed to have ignored the majority of Aoko's explanation and only reacted to the part that caught his curiosity.",
		"\"...To get back on topic,",
		"  Modern arms don't stand a chance against those things. Even rockets would be useless. They aren't part of the same order or shared consciousness as us.\"",
		"\"To the Ploy Rickshaws-to the fairy tale monsters-anything that doesn't exist in their world, anything they don't understand, disintegrates before it can even touch them.",
		"  Only something equally nonsense can touch them, like magical energy infused with the same level of Mystics. They exist wholly in their own conceptual space or cosmos-\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"\"...Ahem.",
		"  In short, they exist according to a special law known as Folklore Defense, meaning that neither pure force nor strong magecraft have much effect. They can't be taken down without exploiting the weaknesses found in their original stories.",
		"  Are you familiar with the Greek myth of Achilles? It's a good, straightforward example.\"",
		"  Soujuurou shook his head.",
		"\"Of course you aren't. If we get out of this alive, have Tobimaru tell you about it.",
		"  It's a cliché, but it's a good story.\"",
		"  Soujuurou was feeling pretty lost, but he did his best to grasp the situation.",
		"He thought that Ploy Kickshaws were scary enough to chase Aoko and that puppet from before out of the house barefoot.",
		"  Certainly, the scene before them was the stuff of nightmares.",
		"  But Soujuurou had a different way of thinking.",
		"\"I think you're more scared than me, Aozaki.\"",
		"\"Do you want to die?!\"",
		"  Soujuurou waved in protest, silently pointing out that she had made his case for him.",
		"\"Listen to me: the things surrounding us now are little more than fodder.",
		"  As far as Alice is concerned, the bread-men, the lobster, the meat mincer at the sausage place-they're all worth even less than my magic bullets are to me.",
		"  Got it? The moving mascots and all the rest are a sideshow. They're nothing more than the breath of the monster she unleashed.\"",
		"\"These thongs... are just the breath?\"",
		"\"Yeah, crazy, I know.",
		"  But that's what we're dealing with right now. Just one of those fairy-tale monsters is enough to keep us busy.",
		"So if Alice decides to add another, we might as well give up.\"",
		"\"Add another? Isn't there some sort of limit?\"",
		"\"If she decides not to be stingy, she has a few more up her sleeve. Though... well, there are conditions to bringing them out.",
		"  Like one monster that won't wake up if there's no river nearby. The park has fountains, sure, but no river, right? Her familiars are bound by their underlying stories.\"",
		"\"By fairy tale, you mean like the one about a bowl of soba noodles?\"",
		"\"Let me tell you, it's a small mercy there's no river here. Otherwise, something way better at squishing us would have appeared by now.\"",
		"  Aoko continued, completely ignoring Soujuurou.",
		"\"Anyway, as I was saying...",
		"  The foundation of Alice's magecraft is Mother Goose.",
		"Right, you wouldn't know that either. Mother Goose was an author of whimsical English nursery rhymes.",
		"  To be honest, this type of Ploy Kickshaw isn't all that scary.",
		"Taking them down with some form of magecraft is totally possible.",
		"\"...I'm afraid to ask, but what about the scary kind, then?\"",
		"\"They follow a another fairy tale also inspired by Mother Goose.",
		"  Alice's mother was particularly fond of it, and every single one is bizarre. No mage wants to go up against one of those things.\"",
		"\"As it happens, that's exactly what brought the park back to life.",
		"  I'm pretty sure it's the one she calls Flat Snark, though I wasn't particularly paying attention, so I'm a little hazy on the details.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou swallowed the discomfort making its way up his throat.",
		"  He really wanted her to explain things a little less vaguely, but something she had just said necessitated further investigation.",
		"\"Wait a second, Aozaki. You mean to tell me you weren't paying attention?\"",
		"\"Well, you know, it was a while back that she explained it all to me, and I didn't really believe anything she had to say around then.",
		"  I thought that maybe she was talking up her own magecraft to a newbie, or that she wasn't taking me seriously. Ahaha.\"",
		"  In truth, if anyone hadn't taken the lesson seriously, it was Aoko.",
		"  She would learn that lesson firsthand soon enough, when she experienced just how real Alice's monsters were.",
		"  She'd also discover how heretical the Meinster witches truly were, in the world of magecraft.",
		"\"...Can you remember anything else about them?\"",
		"\"From what I understand, it's a Ploy that puts up a powerful Bounded Field.",
		"Alice inherited a lot of Ploys, but this is one of her finest.",
		"  It takes discarded and forgotten things and resurrects them like what happens in fairy tales. Supposedly, nobody's ever defeated it.",
		"  Oh, and its nickname is 'The Untouchable.'\"",
		"\"So it's not Flat Snark, or whatever it was?\"",
		"\"That's just a nickname, too. Since nobody knows what its real form is, it picked up a few names along the way.",
		"  One of them is 'Flat Snark,' and it ranks high among her other nonsense in terms of how little is known about it.",
		"  Have you heard of the book The Hunting of the Snark by Lewis Carroll?\"",
		"\"No, and who is Loo-wis Car-rel?\"",
		"\"Okay, then... let's start from the beginning. Professor Dodgson was, hmm. He was a delusional gentleman with a peculiar disposition. Not that it matters right now. It's a waste of time to explain to some people.\"",
		"\"What's important is the work he left behind.",
		"  The Hunting of the Snark is a book about a band of adventurers who try to capture an unidentified monster known as the Snark.\"",
		"\"It's very Carroll: satirical, nonsensical, and cryptic. It doesn't even really have an ending, either. Though the party does ultimately find the Snark on its island after much hardship, it ends with the protagonist who found it, the Baker, suddenly disappearing.",
		"It's a satire about people who run about busily trying to find something they don't understand. But when it comes to the park here, it's pretty clear who the Baker is and who the Snark is, right?\"",
		"  Aoko elected not to share this, but Flat Snark had other popular names as well.",
		"  The Enigmatic Island. The Five-Dimensional Plane.",
		"  These names were not given to it by Alice, but rather muttered by mages whom the Meinsters defeated.",
		"  In mathematics, 'snark' is a term used in graph theory to refer to contradictory and impossible planar graphs.",
		"  A plane, proven to be unable to exist in this world, was given the name, apt for an ill-fated existence paradoxical in nature.",
		"  The fairy-tale monster ascribed this name was said to hold no form discoverable by man.",
		"  Aoko also declined to mention something else:",
		"  Flat Snark was a fairy-tale monster that could grow.",
		"  It would hide somewhere in the amusement park, continuously exhaling magical energy until the park completely transformed into a fantasy land.",
		"\"...Well, it's not like there's any point in scaring him.\"",
		"\"Did you say something, Aozaki?\"",
		"\"Nope. I was just thinking, Flat Snark's power is its ability to bring fairy-tale worlds to life...",
		"  When you think about it, the park makes for the perfect backdrop. I mean, it was originally a playground based on fairy tales, anyway.\"",
		"  If this had been a business district, for example, Flat Snark would have posed far less of a threat.",
		"  At most, its power would be limited to projecting the shadow of a dinosaur onto a building's window panes.",
		"\"Ah, so that's why it's safe he―",
		" Hmm?\"",
		"  Soujuurou realized that something was wrong when he noticed a glutinous liquid dripping onto his back.",
		"\"Oh, oh no...\"",
		"  He looked up to the ceiling.",
		"Their eyes met.",
		"Before he had a chance to think, Soujuurou hopped up from the floor.",
		"\"Aozaki, get out, now!\"",
		"  Taking the initiative, he jumped out from behind the counter.",
		"\"Are you mad? What do you think you're―\"",
		"  Busy trying to stop him from committing an act of suicide, she also came to her feet.",
		"  Immediately she noticed something being brought to life overhead.",
		"\"What the―!? Oh crap!\"",
		"\"Oh my god, that was close!\"",
		"  The gargantuan mouth clamped shut.",
		"  With no mascot to speak of, the burger joint itself began to transform into one giant monster.",
		"\"Who the hell paints a giant clown on the ceiling!?",
		"  Shouldn't they have flexed their creative muscle somehow else?! If they liked clowns that much, why didn't they put it at the entrance?!\"",
		"  Aoko aired out her grievances as she ran.",
		"  ...There was no safe haven left.",
		"  Moment by moment, the last remnants of civilization were being eroded away by fairy tales.",
		"  The amusement park had reached the final stage of Snarkification.",
		"  It was not just the mascot characters that had been granted life;",
		"  like the burger joint, even the buildings had begun to transform.",
		"  The roller coaster that made its way about the park writhed and twisted like a Chinese dragon.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Aoko and Soujuurou stared, dumbfounded by the Ferris wheel, which had grown to over eighty meters in height.",
		"  Hordes of bread-men closed in on them, as if to offer tickets.",
		"\"I'm telling you, the line is under control!\"",
		"  Mobs of trinkets―actual kickshaws―rampaged the park.",
		"  Whenever a hole was punched in the envelopment, it was instantly filled.",
		"  It was a battle of attrition with no end in sight.",
		"But that was a matter of course, as there were few fairy tales about limited resources.",
		"\"This is hopeless!",
		"  They just keep coming!\"",
		"\"Look for the Snark's real form!",
		"  A fairy tale monster always has some vessel for its body! If we can just destroy that, we should be able to get out of here!\"",
		"\"A body? What kind of body?!\"",
		"\"I already told you, fairy tale monsters can't exist in reality! Anything weird or impossible you've never seen before―that's going to be it!\"",
		"\"Something weird or impossible? I need an example!\"",
		"\"Do I have to spell it out for you?!",
		"  Living puppets, flying go karts...\"",
		"  Aoko paused her firing for a moment.",
		"  After saying this out loud, she realized just how deep their grave was dug.",
		"  The amusement park was a treasure trove of fairy tale-esque creatures on any given day.",
		"  Who could say what was impossible amidst the newly transfigured knickknacks running around?",
		"\"...Damn. Everything in here is a weird.\"",
		"(So it's hiding in plain sight...)",
		"  Hoping that she was wrong, Aoko bit her bottom lip.",
		"  Flat Snark was the type of Ploy that deployed Bounded Fields.",
		"  Seeing as it was commanding so many familiars, it would not be unusual for its main body to have little or even no defenses.",
		"  Furthermore, if it was modeled from a story about it being untouchable and unidentifiable, it would be logical to assume that it would collapse in on itself shortly after being discovered.",
		"(Which means... We find it, we win.",
		"  Would something so fragile really hide among its minions? They do say that the best place to hide a leaf is in the woods...)",
		"  This was closer to the truth than Aoko realized.",
		"  As long as there was the slightest possibility of it being hit by one of Aoko's stray bullets, it would not dare appear in front of them.",
		"  Its true form was orchestrating the park from somewhere safe.",
		"(I'm sure we've seen it already.",
		"  It's the subject of a book named after it. If it's not standing out on every page, it has no right to be the title character!)",
		"  But where?",
		"  Thinking in the most basic terms, the Ferris wheel was very safe, as well as a symbol of the park itself. Perhaps...",
		"\"What if we just try to catch that girl instead?!\"",
		"  Her eyes opened wide at the sudden suggestion.",
		"  While Aoko had been trying to come up with a plan to overcome this stalemate, it seemed Soujuurou had been racking his brain as well.",
		"  His proposal was a simple one.",
		"  If they could not find the Snark, they just needed to take out its master, Alice.",
		"  Alice had not moved at all from the clock tower.",
		"  Even from here, they could make out her figure, draped in moonlight.",
		"\"That's the worst move we could make!",
		"  Even if we killed her, it wouldn't stop the Snark, and all of this absurdity would just boil over to outside the park!",
		"  Not to mention, I can't even kill her in the first place! At best, I could only get halfway there!\"",
		"  A bread-man, angered at the insults hurled toward its master, moved to attack and was mercilessly burned to a crisp.",
		"  The two stood back-to-back, catching their breath.",
		"  With no plan to speak of and no route of escape, they had reached rock bottom.",
		"  Meanwhile, the oddities were forming a circle around their prey, as if they smelled blood in the water.",
		"  Were they to be dragged into a bakery for the oven?",
		"  Minced in the meat grinder at the butcher shop?",
		"  Skewered and paraded around atop the carousel?",
		"  Walk the plank of the thorny pirate ship?",
		"  After two years of slumber, they were eager to welcome their new guests.",
		"\"There's something I need to ask you, Aozaki.\"",
		"\"What is it? Keep it snappy, I'm thinking here.\"",
		"\"Okay. It's painfully clear what these things want to do to us, but what about her? Does she enjoy this?\"",
		"\"I doubt it.",
		"These things' hatred of humans comes from a deep-seated grudge within the park itself, and maybe even Flat Snark's personality too. Alice's familiars are one big family of freaks.",
		"  Though, now that you mention it...\"",
		"  Aoko was unable to deny that there were some similarities.",
		"\"Good to know. ...So, did you come up with anything, Aozaki? How do we stop them?\"",
		"\"Sorry to get your hopes up, but I'm all out of ideas. Oh, but I bet they'd stop if you dropped dead.\"",
		"\"No thank you! Let's just get out of here!\"",
		"\"Hey, wait! Shizuki?!\"",
		"  She blinked in surprise at the sudden turn of events.",
		"  Soujuurou, who had until now been meekly following her lead, had grabbed Aoko's hand and pulled her with him into a suicidal charge towards the swarm of bread, in an attempt to break out of the encirclement.",
		"\"Are you out of your mind?!",
		"  How on earth do you figure this is what we do next?!\"",
		"  Aoko nonetheless followed Soujuurou's uncharacteristically gung-ho lead, cursing him all the while.",
		"  Soujuurou would not be able to break through the surrounding wall of enemies with brute force.",
		"  Aoko regained her bearings and let fly a spray of magic bullets ahead of Soujuurou.",
		"\"Hah...!\"",
		"  They broke through the net and ran as hard as they could.",
		"  At this point, all that was left to do was what they had planned from the outset: aim to get out of the park.",
		"  But not before addressing what needed to be addressed.",
		"\"Where the hell did that come from! Hadn't you already given up back at the house of mirrors?!\"",
		"  Aoko could not begin to comprehend Soujuurou's reaction.",
		"\"That was then and this is now! Just run!\"",
		"\"What are you talking about?! Alice wants to kill you just like I did! Nothing's different, not the reason nor the outcome!\"",
		"  Though she wondered what was getting her so worked up, Aoko did not stop.",
		"  She told herself that the degree of Soujuurou's stupidity, charging the bread-men so recklessly, had caused her to lose her cool.",
		"\"Hey, don't get the wrong idea! I'm gonna try and kill you again tomorrow! I'll really do it! So if you don't want to die, you should be trying to escape me too, got it?!\"",
		"\"Then let's talk about that tomorrow! Like I said, I don't really care if you kill me, I just don't want to be killed by that girl!\"",
		"\"And like I said, WHY THE HELL NOT?!\"",
		"\"I don't even know what she looks like, nor have I even spoken with her!\"",
		"\"...What?\"",
		"  It was like someone had doused water over her blazing fury.",
		"  Aoko's anger was snuffed out by the absurd simplicity of his reasoning.",
		"\"Because you don't even know what she looks like?\"",
		"  Could it be that Soujuurou did not mind being killed by someone as long as he had met them?",
		"  Aoko chased behind him, grimacing at the ever-increasing incomprehensibility of it all."
