		"　あらゆる寓話、",

		"「……随分と身勝手ね。",

		"　遠くて顔ははっきりしないが、何度か町で見かけたかもしれない。",
		"　それが何処だったかを思い出そうとするのだが、妙な緊張感が邪魔をして、どうにもはっきりしなかった。",
		"「―――驚いた。ずいぶんと仲間思いになったのね有珠。",
		"　今夜は私に任せるんじゃなかったっけ？」",
		"　青子はわずかに身構え、半歩だけ前に出た。",
		"　無意識に。",

		"「……そうね。仲間思い、に当てはまるかは微妙だけど、良くない予感がしたから様子を見に来ただけ。",

		"「それはどうも。どうせならもう少し早く、その良くない予感とやらに気づいてほしかったけど。",
		"　―――でもま、ごらんの通り自己解決したわ。",
		"　夜も遅いし、さっさと帰っていいわよ有珠。私の仕事っぷりを疑うワケじゃないんでしょう？」",
		"　両者の視線が交差する。",

		"「……いえ、気が変わったわ。",
		"　せっかくだし<二|・><人|・><で|・><帰|・><り|・><ま|・><し|・><ょ|・><う|・>。その方が貴女らしいわ。帰りしな、人形の話でも聞かせてちょうだい」",

		"「…………」",
		"　可憐な唇が<落胆|らくたん>の息をこぼす。",
		"　黒衣の少女は怒るというより呆れたように、",
		"「……青子。口にしたくないけど、本気？」",

		"　二年近くともに暮らした同居人を問いただした。",
		"「――――――」",
		"「……呆れた。二人で秘密を守ると言ったのに？",
		"　まだ半端にそっち側なの？　それとも情でも移った？」",
		"「別に。情っていうより私の気分よ。",

		"そっちこそ、一度した約束は絶対守",

		"　少女はもう一度、今度はさっきより大きなため息をついて、",
		"「言い争いは後にしましょう。",
		"　そこの彼を<い|・><な|・><か|・><っ|・><た|・><事|・>にするのは、私だけで十分だし」",
		"　つい、と。",
		"　チェスの駒をさすような仕草で、細い指を動かした。",
		"“うん？”",
		"　それは、蒼崎青子に命を狙われ、まがりなりにも自動人形を目撃した草十郎をして、目を見張る“不思議”だった。",
		"　……青子の暴挙、動く人形。",
		"　それらは常識外とは言え、<現|そ><実|こ>にあるものから派生した出来事だ。彼にとっては驚きこそすれ、不思議に思う事はない。",
		"　しかし。",
		"　何もない空間、何の関連もない動作から突如あらわれたソレは、彼にとっては不思議以外の何物でもなかった。",
		"　草十郎は手品に見惚れるよう、指一本動かせず少女の魔術に襲われる。",

		"「あ、やば」",
		"　青子は脊髄反射で手をだしてしまい、しまった、と反省する。",
		"「…………どういう事？　<言葉|やくそく>を曲げただけじゃなく、ルールまで破るつもり？」",
		"　……ただでさえ冷えきっていた真冬の空気が、もう氷結レベルまで落ちこんでいく。",
		"　有珠はクールそうに見えて、その実、青子以上に激情家なところがあった。",
		"　その最たるものが、使い魔への扱いである。",
		"　悪意のないミスで壊してしまった場合は一週間程度の無言の抗議で済むが、",
		"　悪意をもって破壊したのなら、もうどんな言い訳があろうと報復するのが彼女の性格だった。",
		"“あっちゃあ……いつかやるとは思ったけど、ついに<逆鱗|げきりん>に触れちゃったか……”",
		"　あーあ、と。自分の馬鹿さ加減に呆れながらも、青子は<清々|すがすが>しさを感じていた。",
		"　言い訳をする気はないし、後悔もしていない。",
		"　ルールを破ったというのなら、それは有珠も同じである。",
		"「青子」",
		"「ま、なんていうか―――」",
		"　逆にさっぱりしたぐらいだ。",
		"　だって、こうなった以上はもう色々仕方がない。",
		"　青子には自分のルールを破る気なんて毛頭なく、",
		"　反省する事があるといったら、それは力加減を間違えた事だけで、",
		"「<私|わたし>的に、今夜コイツに死なれるのは困るのよ。",
		"　なんで、日を改めて殺しに来てくれない有珠？　いいでしょ、たった一日ぐらい」",
		"　とっさに容疑者Ｓをかばったのは、彼女にとって当然の正義だった。",
		"「それは私情？」",
		"「悪い？　一宿一飯の恩義ってわりと大事にしてるの、私」",
		"「わたしとの協定より？」",
		"「ええ。時と場合によっては」",
		"　この場にいる<草十郎|さんにんめ>の人権もなんのその。",
		"　少女たちは互いに油をかけあっていく。",
		"　感情の切り替え―――いや、感情に火をつけるのは、黒衣の少女の方が先だった。",
		"「―――そう。よく分かったわ青子。",
		"　わたしは彼をここで殺す。",
		"　貴女は彼をここだけ生かす。",
		"　……つまり。<わ|・><た|・><し|・><と|・><戦|・><う|・>、という事でいい？」",
		"“……ふん。そんなの、いいワケないじゃない”",
		"　なんて弱音をぐっと堪える。",
		"　青子は有珠の魔術を知っている。",
		"　あの小さな体にどれほどの神秘を秘めているか、痛いほど経験している。",
		"　勝ち目はほとんど、ぜったい<皆無|かいむ>。",
		"　そして一度でも口火をきれば、久遠寺有珠は容赦なしだ。",
		"　同居人であろうと友人だろうと、",
		"　彼女の最愛の肉親であろうと、",
		"　魔女として戦う以上、あの少女は<冷徹|れいてつ><無|む><比|ひ>な怪物となる。",

		"　今さら後には退けない。<事|コ><態|ト>はもう、どうでもいい<目撃者|だいさんしゃ>を<巡|めぐ>っての言い争いではない。",
		"　彼女たちの友情らしきものは、実力差はどうあれ、精神的に対等である事が成立の条件になっている。",
		"　だからこそ―――『自分』を通すのであれば、妥協も誤魔化しも、する訳にはいかなかった。",
		"「もちろん。アンタを殺す事になっても、そこのバカは生かしきるわ。それに―――」",
		"　うなりをあげて式を走らせる魔術回路。",
		"先の人形戦では眠っていた身体が、その真価を発揮させろと燃え上がり―――",
		"「それに。どのみち最後には殺し合う仲でしょ、私たち……！」",
		"　闘志を<以|もっ>て、強敵への恐怖を克服する―――！",
		"　青子の魔弾は自身の体……魔術回路を銃身にして魔力を放つ、ごく単純な魔術式だ。",
		"　風を起こす、水を分ける、<劣化|じかん>をかける、といった自然干渉ではない。",
		"　魔力という架空の運動を実在へと加工し、熱量として撃ちだしている。",
		"　なので、その破壊力は青子が扱える魔力量がイコールとなる。",
		"　草十郎相手に使用した魔弾は<一工程|シングルアクション>、詠唱を必要としない最低限の魔術だった。",
		"　現状、青子が主武器とする魔弾には三つの工程がある。",
		"　これはその二つめ。",
		"　魔術刻印を<起動|リード>させ、簡略化詠唱を用いた二工程の魔弾である。",
		"　しかし。",
		"　それなりに気合いを込めた青子の魔弾を、少女は<瞬|またた>き一つせず霧散させた。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　ち、と舌打ちする青子。",
		"　不意打ちの速攻―――詠唱を簡略した魔術行使では、久遠寺有珠の守りは破れない。",
		"「相変わらずお<堅|かた>いこと。その<殻|カラ>、一段と独りよがりになってるんじゃない？」",
		"　青子は内心の焦りをおくびにも出さず挑発する。",
		"　そのやせ我慢が気に入ったのか。",
		"「売り言葉に買い言葉、というヤツね。",
		"　こういう、勢いだけのきっかけは初めてだけど……」",
		"「驚いたわ。こんな下らない理由でも、その気になるものなのね、人間って」",
		"　くすりと。",
		"　心の底から感心するように微笑んで、少女は左手の指を地上に向けた。",
		"　<刺|zap>す。<刺|zap>す。<刺|zap>す。<刺|zap>す。",
		"　広場の地面、レンガを破って突き出る無数の槍。",
		"「静希君、後ろに跳んで！」",
		"「？」",
		"　青子は呼びかけながら、彼が反応するより早く手を取って後ろに跳んだ。",
		"　地面から湧き立つ器物は意志を持つように、跳び退く青子たちを追いかける。",
		"　槍の守りは放射状に広がり、青子と草十郎を時計台から離していく。",
		"「―――え、これで終わり？」",
		"　後ろに下がること十メートル弱。",
		"　地面を砕いて現れる凶器たちの成長は、青子の予想より小規模に留まった。",
		"　少女の立つ時計台を守るソレは、<磔|はりつけ>にされた魔女を責める<薪|たきぎ>のようで―――",
		"“……普通、逆じゃない？　ここは私たちを逃がさないよう、槍で周りを囲むものでしょう……？”",
		"　青子と草十郎の後ろには安全な道がある。",
		"　その気になれば二人は遊園地の入り口まで走って、そのまま町へ逃げられる。",
		"「いいの有珠？",
		"　悪いけど、逃げられるなら逃げるわよ、私」",
		"　町にまで出れば青子の勝ちだ。",
		"　今夜だけ草十郎を見逃したい青子にとって、彼を街に逃がしてしまえば目的は大部分達成―――",
		"「？」",
		"　―――なのだが。",
		"　有珠は眼下の標的に目もくれず、愛しい、大切なものを扱うように<小瓶|こびん>を取り出した。",
		"「緑の……フラスコ？",
		"　あれってたしか―――やばっ、とにかく<撃て|ファイヤ>―――！」",
		"　防がれる魔弾。",
		"　青子の顔には、もう一片の余裕もない。",
		"　……そう。",
		"　増長していたと言えば、青子はたしかに増長していた。",
		"　この二年、学び続けた魔術に手応えもあった。",
		"　同居人の性格、魔術もそれなりに把握していた。",
		"　だから―――最善の立ち回りをすれば、久遠寺有珠に一杯くわせられると思い上がったのだ。",
		"「あ―――」",
		"　……魔法の<瓶|びん>の<蓋|ふた>が開く。",
		"　頬を優しい風が<撫|な>でる。",
		"　夜の饗宴が、新たな主役の登場に尻尾を巻いて逃げ出していく。",
		"　―――どこからか。",
		"　懐かしい、パレードの足音がやってくる。",
		"「う、そ―――」",
		"　それは。",
		"　魔術師見習いである蒼崎青子ですら、体験した事のない奇跡だった。",
		"　死んでいたモノが蘇る。",
		"　生きていないモノが目を覚ます。",
		"　霧に包まれた深い森。",
		"　沼地にひそむ火を噴くトカゲ。",
		"　午前零時をむかえてはしゃぎだすパペットたち。",
		"　久遠寺有珠の細い指は、年老いた猫の背中を撫でるように優しく、遊園地全体を変貌させ―――",
		"　　「いいわ―――",
		"ごっこ遊びをしましょう、青子」",
		"　……ありし日の夢の廃棄場は、一夜かぎりの王国に生まれ変わる。",
		"　それは現実を侵食する不死身の魔物。",
		"　<一度|ひとたび>解き放たれれば、決して獲物を逃がさない暗黒童話。",
		"「逃げられるものなら逃げてみせて。",
		"　どこまで行けるか分からないけど―――この夜を越える事ができたのなら、貴女の勝ちにしてあげる」",
		"　……絶望的な戦いの開幕宣言。",
		"　親愛と悲しみ、それと無邪気な愉悦をこめて、",
		"　黒衣の魔女は友人へと<歌|わら>いかけた。",
		"　けれど、希望はいつだって束の間のもの。",
		"　彼らの希望は三百メートル分しか続かなかった。",
		"　遊園地の果ては、何の比喩もなく“世界の果て”そのものだったのだから。",
		"　波立つ、何十という地平線。",
		"　それは<群雲|むらくも>のような、<緞帳|どんちょう>のような、",
		"　あるいは呻きをもらす<唇|ひだ>のような、",
		"　あまりにも奇怪で、あまりにも童話めいた、この世界の行き止まり。",
		"　―――さながら。",
		"　巨大な紙芝居の最後の一枚だと、彼女は思った。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　その光景を前にした時、青子は不覚にも、一切の思考を放棄した。",
		"　……ああ、たいへんな事になったな、と。",
		"　波立つ境界線を見て、ようやく、この<絶望島|スナーク>に膝を屈した。",
		"　遊園地に終わりはあった。",
		"　青子たちの知っている通り、遊園地と住宅街を<隔|へだ>てる鉄柵はこうして今も。",
		"　鉄柵は二倍ぐらい高くなっていたり、なんだか装飾が頑丈になっていたりするけど、それも想定の範囲内。",
		"　たとえ鉄柵がスナーク化していようと、壁の一枚や二枚なら撃ち抜く<気概|つもり>で彼女はここまでやって来たのだから。",
		"　……けれど。",
		"　目前に広がるモノは、もはや境界ですらなかった。",
		"　この異界と外界を分かつ海。",
		"　鉄柵は寄せ返す<波濤|はとう>の如く。",
		"　一枚、二枚はたやすく破れる。",
		"　十枚、二十枚までは何とか進める。",
		"　残った自身の魔力と、遊園地に満ちた魔力と、魔術回路と刻印を焼き切れるまで総動員すれば、ただ一度きり、<十戒|じっかい>の真似事ぐらいはやってみせると強がれる。",
		"「―――でも、それで終わり」",
		"　この海を割った後、青子には立ち上がる体力さえ残らない。",
		"　……その後の運命は明白だ。",
		"　さんざん遊園地を壊してまわった青子を、住人たちは決して許しはしないだろう。<蜜|みつ>にたかる<蟻|あり>の如く、動けなくなった少女を八つ裂きにする。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　<落胆|らくたん>と疲れから、微かな後悔がこぼれる。",
		"　遊園地から外に出る。",
		"　その選択自体が間違いだったと認めて、青子は来た道を振り返った。",
		"　<金色|こんじき>の満月の下、鉄骨はうねり、針金細工のように集まっている。",
		"　遊園地そのものが巨大な“怪物”になるのも時間の問題だ。",
		"　有珠のいる広場には大量の使い魔が集っており近寄れもしない。",
		"　傍らに立つ少年の頭上には、かわらず表面をシャッフルし続ける<囁く卵|スクラッチ・ダンプティ>。",
		"「―――蒼崎！」",
		"「静希君……？」",
		"　少年の声に、止まっていた思考が動き出す。",
		"　……けれど、それも一瞬。",
		"　魔術師である青子は現状を把握してしまう。",
		"　その絶望が、彼女から抗う<選択|いし>を根こそぎ奪っていた。",
		"「<正門|ゲート>に行こう。ここはどうしようもないけど、入り口ならもうちょっとマシだろう。",
		"　フラットスナークだっけ？　コイツにもルールがあるって言ったじゃないか。",
		"なら、これは役割の問題だ。はじめから鉄柵は通れない壁だけど、正門なら出入り口として機能しているかも知れない」",
		"　草十郎はパニックに<陥|おちい>っていない。",
		"　この状況でスナークの特性を読み取れるのは凄いな、と青子は素直に感心した。",
		"　冷めきった、覚悟を決めた心持ちで。",
		"「……そうね。たしかに門はあると思う。",
		"　けど、たどり着くのは難しいわ。一番弱かった焼きたてパンですら、今はもうアレだもの。",
		"　広場や入り口にはもっと上等なのがたむろしてるだろうし、門だって、あの観覧車以上の怪物かもしれない。たしか大きなキッツィーちゃんだったでしょ、正門って」",
		"「……蒼崎は正門には行かないのか？」",
		"「まあね。それよりこっちの方が現実的だし」",
		"「？」",
		"　青子は波立つ鉄柵を<一瞥|いちべつ>する。",
		"　既に『生きて脱出する』という目標は達成できない。",
		"　である以上、残ったもう一つの約束を優先しようと、彼女は心を切り替えていた。",
		"「今からこの鉄柵を壊すから、貴方はそこから外に出て。",
		"　それで、私の役割はおしまいよ」",
		"「――――――」",
		"　言葉は少なかったが、淡々とした声がすべてを物語っている。",
		"　彼女は彼に、ひとりで逃げろと言ったのだ。",
		"「……信じられない。",
		"　こんなの、蒼崎だけじゃ壊せないだろう」",
		"「私だけならね。でも、今はこの遊園地が味方してる。燃料がこれだけあるんだから、私は銃身になるだけでいいんだし。一発でかいのお見舞いしてやるわ。",
		"　……ま、それでも一回が限度だから、穴をあけたら、アンタには全力で走り抜けてもらうしかないけど」",
		"　この鉄柵の海に道を作る。",
		"　それは彼女の持てる力を総動員しての、一度きりの大詠唱、大射程の極限魔弾。",
		"「――――――」",
		"　門外漢である草十郎には、それがどれほどの負担をかけるものか想像もできない。ただ漠然と、遊園地に取り残される青子の姿が思い浮かぶ。",
		"　……残された彼女はどうなるのか。",
		"　あの黒衣の少女は彼女を助けるのか。",
		"　無慈悲な話だが、それはない。",
		"　青子が草十郎を助けるために最善を尽くした以上、あの少女も手を<緩|ゆる>めはしないだろう。",
		"　有珠が青子を見逃すとしたら、それは青子が自分の<命|いのち>惜しさに草十郎を殺した時だけだ。",
		"　そして、",
		"「二十メートルぐらい離れてて。",
		"<詠唱|じゅんび>に手間どるけど、その卵の表面がゆで上がるまでには終わらせるから」",
		"　言うまでもなく、彼女はその道を選ばない。",
		"「待ってくれ。",
		"　俺を逃がすっていうけど、それに意味はあるのか、蒼崎」",
		"「……ないけど。外に出られたところで有珠から逃げきれるとは思えないし。",
		"けど、これぐらいは最後の意地よ。守るって言ったんだから、できるところまでやらないと」",
		"　その芯の強さを、彼は驚きながら再認識した。",
		"　……つまりはそういうこと。",
		"　彼女は草十郎のためではなく、自分の誇りのために戦っている。",
		"「……うん、そうだったな。",
		"　けど、それなら俺だけ逃がすのはらしくないぞ」",
		"「な、なによ。いいから離れてて」",
		"　なんとなく、ちょっとだけ後退する青子。",
		"　つい一時間ほど前、この顔に一本とられた事を思い出したのだ。",
		"「蒼崎。まだ意地を張れるんなら、他の事をやろう。",
		"　このお化けみたいな鉄柵を壊せるなら、他に壊すべきものがあるはずだ」",
		"「ないわよ。悪いけど、私は目に見えるものしか壊せないの。最後までカタチのない希望にすがるとか、考えるのも寒気がする。",
		"いい？　今はフラットスナークなんかより、この壁を壊してアンタを<足抜|あしぬ>けさせるのが私の現実。私に負える最大限の責任って―――」",
		"「逃げるのか」",
		"　背中を向けようとした青子の手が掴まれる。",
		"　その一言が少女の心を<沸騰|ふっとう>させた。",
		"　本当に、心臓に火を放たれたようだ。",
		"　本心を突かれた驚きと、自分自身への不甲斐なさが、凍っていた手足を蘇らせる。",
		"「誰が―――！　逃げるのはそっちで、逃がしてあげるのはこっちだって言うのよ！　甘く見ないで、いざとなったら遊園地ごと爆破してみせるわ！」",
		"「そうか。なら、ここで俺を逃がすのは無駄だな。",
		"その気迫は本命のためにとっておこう。それまでは俺も手伝うから」",
		"「はあ!?　手伝う!?　それこそ無駄な気遣いよ！",
		"　あったまきた、いいから逃げろバカ！　だいたい、走りづめで息もたえだえなヤツなんか使えないわよ！」",
		"「そりゃいいかげんヘトヘトだけど。",
		"そういう蒼崎なんか、疲れ以上に傷の方が痛んでるだろ」",
		"　青子本人ですら忘れかけていた背中の痛み。",
		"　自動人形に強打された彼女の背中は、今では無視できないほどの痛みを<訴|うった>えていた。",
		"　青子は単に、鉄の自制心で背中の傷を後回しにしていただけなのだ。",
		"「ほら。魔術とか抜きにすれば、まだ俺の方がマシじゃないか。入り口までおぶっていくコトぐらいなら、なんとか」",
		"「できないコトは口にしないで。",
		"　……もう、いいから行って。慣れているもの、私は。でも貴方は違う。こういうの初めてでしょ？",
		"　だから、いいの」",
		"　こうして協力されるのも、",
		"　結局はそのあと少年を殺さなければいけない事も、",
		"　全部ひっくるめて彼女は言った。",
		"　もういいの、と。",
		"　けれど、草十郎は手を離さなかった。",
		"　掴んだ手の力は一段と増している。",
		"　<表情|かお>はいつものままだけど、もしかして怒っているのかな、と青子は眉を<曇|くも>らせた。",
		"「たしかに、こういうのは初めてだ。",
		"　けど、山じゃ危険な目ぐらいあってる。<鹿|シカ>に襲われた事だってあるんだぞ、俺は」",
		"「――――――」",
		"　少女は都会の人間で、シカ、なんて単語を出されてもいまいち実感は湧かなかったけれど、少年には確かな覚悟があると感じ取れた。",
		"　……たしかに。",
		"　振り返れば、彼は努めて冷静だった。",
		"　普通ならパニック状態で会話する事さえ困難だろう。",
		"　それをここまで、なんとか冷静でいようと努力できるのは、文明から離れた山奥で暮らしていたからなのか。",
		"「だから信じてくれ。少しでいいから」",
		"　飾り気のない本心。",
		"　簡潔な気持ちを口にして、草十郎は手を離した。",
		"　……少年の言葉に嘘はない。",
		"　それが余計、少女には信じられなかった。",
		"　だって、草十郎にはそこまでの事をする理由がない。",
		"　今の青子にはあらゆる未来がない。",
		"　それを白状して逃げろと言っているのに、どうしてこの少年は、こんな自分に協力すると言うのだろう―――",
		"「分からない。どうしてそこまでするの。",
		"　私に付き合えば貴方は死ぬのよ。",
		"これが最後だから、ちゃんと考えてよね。……貴方はここで逃げるべきよ」",
		"「それは分かるよ。でも行かない」",
		"　即答しながら、青子はその理由をこそ求めている、と草十郎は気が付いた。",
		"　普段の彼からすればまさに<喝采|かっさい>ものの察しの良さで、",
		"「そうすると、蒼崎が死んでしまいそうだ」",
		"　でた言葉は、いつも通りの理由の無さ。",
		"「だから、どうしてそこまでするのよアンタはっ！」",
		"　苛立ちから怒鳴り付ける。",
		"　少年は少しだけ考えこんでから、",
		"「―――そりゃあ、君が好きだからだろ」",
		"　あっさりと。",
		"　なんでそんなこと訊くんだ？　なんて顔で返答した。",
		"　……一秒か、たぶん二秒ほど。",
		"　あまりの不意打ちに、青子の時間は止まってしまった。",
		"　切り札を隠していたのは有珠だけではなかったようだ。",
		"　今の一言は、フラットスナークなんかより底が深い。",
		"　青子にとってはただただ呆れるばかりの返答。",
		"　けれど単純で頑強な、地上でいちばん強い理由。",
		"「―――はあ」",
		"　自分を殺そうとしている相手に無条件で協力出来るなんて、静希草十郎はやっぱり分からない。",
		"　ただ少しだけ、青子はこの少年の<為人|ひととなり>が掴めた気がした。",
		"　鳶丸たちの評価は、たぶん、間違ってはいないのだ。",
		"口惜しいことに。",
		"「莫迦ね。私は貴方のこと、嫌いなのに」",
		"　なんだか負け惜しみのような呟きに、少年は知ってるよ、と苦笑した。",
		"　意地の張り合いはここで終わり。",
		"　火を放たれた心臓が、青子の体に熱い血液を走らせる。",
		"　だってあんな顔をされたら、ふたりそろって生還する方法しか考えられない。",
		"「……ま、私だって逃げっぱなしは性に合わないし。",
		"　いいわよ、最後まで粘ってみる。それに静希君が付き合ってくれるなら、何かの役には立つでしょう」",

		"  The melody stirred an emotion like nostalgia within them.",
		"  Something once familiar but now lost to this world.",
		"  They believed, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it would play for all eternity.",
		"  From opening stanza to final coda,",
		"  it was a mysterious siren's song, merry yet longing, that heralded a return from dreams to reality.",
		"  The night shook.",
		"  A song was spun.",
		"  Now, their lost paradise was unearthed.",
		"  Abandoned dreams...",
		"  Forsaken idols...",
		"  They all responded to the cry of the blue cat.",
		"  ...The name of that bell was Diddle Diddle, Banquet of the Night.",
		"  All fables made possible,",
		"  all marvels made real,",
		"  by the magecraft of Alice Kuonji, more magical than magic itself.",
		"\"...How selfish of you.",
		"  Is that something you can really decide on your own, Aoko?\"",
		"  Alice sat perched atop the clock tower like a black bird of ill omen.",
		"  She smoothed the ruffles of her skirt as if she were preening. ",
		"\"...Alice.\"",
		"  There was tension in Aoko's voice as she lifted her head.",
		"  The calm atmosphere from a moment prior had long since been shooed away by Alice's gaze.",
		"\"That girl... I've seen her somewhere before.\"",
		"  Soujuurou searched his hazy memory.",
		"  He could not clearly make out her face at this distance, but he was sure he had seen her around town a number of times.",
		"  Where and when eluded him, however, as the tension in the air kept him from connecting all the dots.",
		"\"...Well, isn't this a turn of events. I didn't know you cared so much, Alice.",
		"  I thought you were going to leave tonight to me.\"",
		"  Aoko readied her guard and took half a step forward.",
		"  Unconsciously.",
		"  From an objective standpoint, it almost looked as though she were protecting the figure beside her.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Alice's silence grew ever heavier.",
		"  Her eyes, fixed on the ground below her, were devoid of emotion.",
		"  An indescribable sense of dread and pressure laid claim over the plaza.",
		"\"...A bell...?\"",
		"  If he strained his ears, he could make out the faint ringing of a bell echoing in the distance.",
		"  The rippling soundwave seemed, unbelievably, to be emanating from under the ground.",
		"\"Hey Aozaki, that girl... She's―\"",
		"\"Quiet.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou stepped back, trying to stay out of the way.",
		"  It was as though he had been told to go to hell",
		"  for the crime of asking if the girl was Aoko's friend.",
		"\"I wouldn't go as far as to say I cared. I simply had a feeling something might be wrong and came to check.",
		"  It's not as though I had any doubts regarding your ability to handle the job.\"",
		"\"Much appreciated. It would have been nice if you had thought to come check just a bit earlier, though.",
		"  ...As you can see, things seem to have worked themselves out.",
		"  It's late, so don't let me keep you, Alice. Since you have no doubts about my ability, right?\"",
		"  Their eyes locked on one another.",
		"  Alice's stare was uncomfortably cold.",
		"  Aoko's was bold, daring Alice to air her complaints.",
		"\"...I think I've changed my mind.",
		"  I'm here now, so why don't the two of us go home? That's more your style anyway, Aoko. You can tell me all about your adventures with the puppet on the way.\"",
		"\"Ha! What's that supposed to mean?",
		"  Go home, Alice. Shut yourself in your room and make some more of your worthless birds.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  A disappointed sigh escaped Alice's delicate lips.",
		"  It seemed that the black-clad girl was more astonished than angry.",
		"\"...Aoko. I hate to say this, but... seriously?\"",
		"  Quietly,",
		"  Alice questioned her roommate of nearly two years.",
		"\"...\"",
		"\"...You surprise me. Did you not say we would protect our secret together?",
		"  Are you still having trouble letting go of the other side? Or has compassion taken a hold of you?\"",
		"\"Not at all. This isn't compassion-I just feel like doing it this way.",
		"  No plan survives contact with the enemy, you know that. The same goes for my mood.",
		"Besides, who goes out of her way to keep a promise",
		"she made forever ago? A little old-fashioned, if you ask me.\"",
		"  The proverbial knives were out, now.",
		"  No quarter was given, no quarter taken.",
		"  Sadly, their partnership was one of convenience, and had not reached the level of mutual understanding.",
		"  Their version of friendship was both delicate and unique. When a conflict of opinion arose, each would refuse to budge until the other crumbled.",
		"  Neither was concerned for the other's plight, and at least for now, that was how they liked it.",
		"\"...You know, I've come to accept stupid outbursts like that from you.\"",
		"  Once again she let out a sigh, even larger than the one before.",
		"\"Why don't we save this argument for later?",
		"  I can make him disappear on my own.\"",
		"  Finally, she struck straight to the point.",
		"  As if making to move a chess piece, Alice lifted her slender finger.",
		"\"Hm?\"",
		"  Even this simple action seemed mysterious to Soujuurou, the same boy who had been hunted by his classmate Aoko Aozaki and borne witness to an automaton.",
		"  Aoko's violence and an animated doll-",
		"  Though perhaps far beyond the realm of logic, both these things were derived from reality. As surprised as he had been, there was no need to think of them as total mysteries.",
		"  However...",
		"  When the thing appeared out of thin air from a seemingly unrelated gesture, he had no word for it besides \"mysterious.\"",
		"  Soujuurou stood motionless, captivated by this stage performer's magic trick, as the girl's single-finger magecraft turned into an attack directed at him.",
		"  A blue light flew from the side to repel it, annihilating it without a trace.",
		"\"Oh crap.\"",
		"  Aoko immediately regretted her reflexive shot.",
		"\"...What are you doing? You're not satisfied with breaking just our promise, so you must break the rules as well?\"",
		"  The already-chilled midwinter air plunged below freezing.",
		"  Alice looked calm and collected on the outside, but in reality she was sometimes even more hot-blooded than Aoko.",
		"  Especially when it concerned her familiars.",
		"  Accidentally destroying one often would result in a week of silent treatment,",
		"  but maliciously destroying one... Alice would reserve the right to retaliate without fair warning.",
		"\"Whoops. I figured I'd do that someday, but I couldn't have picked a worse time...\"",
		"  Though Aoko was shocked at the depth of her own stupidity, she also was in fact a little bit relieved.",
		"  She did not intend to make any excuses, and she had no regrets.",
		"  If she had broken the rules, then so had Alice.",
		"\"Aoko.\"",
		"\"How do I put it...\"",
		"  If anything, this took a load off her mind.",
		"  After all, now there was no going back.",
		"  Aoko never intended to break her own rules.",
		"  If there was anything for Aoko to regret, it was putting too little power into her shot.",
		"\"I have a problem with this guy dying tonight.",
		"  So, can we reschedule the execution? What difference does a day make?\"",
		"  Taking on a pro bono case in the defense of Suspect S was the socially acceptable thing.",
		"\"...Is this personal?\"",
		"\"So what if it is? You know that paying back my debts is pretty important to me.\"",
		"\"More important than our agreement?\"",
		"\"Sure, depending on the time and place.\"",
		"  Soujuurou's human rights had not yet entered the argument.",
		"  The girls were busy pouring oil on each other's flames.",
		"  The girl clad in black was the first to move, or rather, to erupt.",
		"\"...I see. I understand how you feel, Aoko.",
		"  But I am going to have to kill him here.",
		"  I believe that you would let him live.",
		"  Shall I take that to mean you're ready to fight me for it?\"",
		"(...Hmph. You know damn well I'd rather not.)",
		"  Aoko bit back the retort.",
		"  She was very familiar with Alice's magecraft,",
		"  and knew painfully well how many Mystics were hidden in Alice's tiny body.",
		"  The odds of victory were essentially nonexistent.",
		"  And once the first shot had been fired, Alice Kuonji was without mercy.",
		"  Whether facing a roommate or a friend,",
		"  a most beloved family member or a stranger,",
		"  once Alice began to fight as a witch, she became a heartless, unflappable monster.",
		"  Aoko advanced another half step forward as if to encourage herself.",
		"  It was too late to back down now. The situation was no longer a trivial quarrel over a witness.",
		"  The bedrock of their so-called friendship had nothing to do with their individual abilities, but everything to do with being equals in will.",
		"  That is why, in order to stay true to herself, Aoko had no room for compromise or deception.",
		"\"Of course. I'm going to make sure this idiot lives, even if it means killing you. And besides...\"",
		"  Her Magic Circuits howled as they kicked into gear.",
		"Her body, which had mostly been dormant during the battle with the puppet, ignited, preparing to demonstrate its true worth.",
		"\"We were going to end up killing each other in the end anyway!\"",
		"  Her courage overpowered any fear she had for her opponent.",
		"  Tuning her body―her Magic Circuits―to become like the barrel of a gun, Aoko fired a magic bullet. It was an exceedingly basic magecraft formula.",
		"  There was no nature interference: no creating of wind, parting of water, or hastening of decay.",
		"  It was simply the process of converting the imaginary action known as magical energy into something real before releasing it as heat.",
		"  Thus Aoko's destructive power was equal to her supply of magical energy.",
		"  The magic bullets she had used against Soujuurou were among the most basic single-action magecraft that did not require an incantation.",
		"  At her present ability, Aoko's main mode of attack―her magic bullet―could be fired at three levels of power.",
		"  These were at the second level.",
		"  This required a double-action magecraft―a casting through activation of her crest combined with a simplified incantation.",
		"  However...",
		"  Without blinking, Alice dispersed the shot that Aoko had mustered all of her spirit to fire.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Aoko tutted in frustration.",
		"  A swift sneak attack, magecraft that used a simplified incantation, would not be enough to break Alice's guard.",
		"\"As stiff as ever, I see. Don't you think that shell is making you complacent?\"",
		"  Aoko provoked Alice in order to disguise her own lack of composure.",
		"  Somehow Alice seemed delighted by Aoko's bravado.",
		"\"I suppose this is what they call 'fighting words.'",
		"  I've never fought to the death for such a trivial reason.\"",
		"\"I'm really shocked. Humans are such conceited creatures.\"",
		"  Alice giggled.",
		"  Smiling with heartfelt amazement, Alice gestured her left hand toward the earth.",
		"  Zap. Zap. Zap. Zap.",
		"  Countless utensils shot out from underneath the cobblestones paving the plaza.",
		"\"Shizuki, get back!\"",
		"\"...?\"",
		"  She grabbed his hand as she shouted, jumping backward before he even had a chance to respond.",
		"  As if they had wills of their own, the utensils that had suddenly appeared from the ground gave chase.",
		"  As the barrier of spears grew around them, Aoko and Soujuurou put some distance between themselves and the clock tower.",
		"\"That all you've got?\"",
		"  Just under ten meters stood between them and Alice.",
		"  The lethal weapons that had crumbled the stone beneath them fell short of what Aoko had anticipated.",
		"  They now encircled the clock tower, making the scene look like the burning of a witch at the stake.",
		"(Isn't this backwards? You'd expect the spears to try and stop us from escaping...)",
		"  The path behind them was safe.",
		"  If they wanted, they could try to make a break for the main gate and escape.",
		"\"Are you sure about this, Alice?",
		"  Sorry, but if you're going to let me escape, I'm not going to pass the chance up.\"",
		"  If she could just make it back to town, it would be Aoko's win.",
		"  All she wanted to do was let Soujuurou get away for the night, so if she could get him back to the city it would be, for the most part, mission accomplished.",
		"\"...?\"",
		"  ...Or so she had thought.",
		"  Without even offering a glance at her targets below, Alice carefully and lovingly pulled out a bottle from her pocket.",
		"\"A green... flask?",
		"  Wait, that's... Damn it! Fire!\"",
		"  Her shot was deflected with ease.",
		"  Gone was Aoko's earlier bravado.",
		"  It was only natural-",
		"  Aoko had indeed grown as a mage.",
		"  Over the last two years of study, her studies had progressed well,",
		"  and she'd more or less gotten a grasp on her roommate's tendencies and abilities.",
		"  This had made her conceited enough to believe that, under favorable circumstances, she'd be able to show Alice a thing or two in a fight.",
		"\"Ah...\"",
		"  Alice uncorked the magical bottle.",
		"  A gentle breeze caressed her cheek.",
		"  Diddle Diddle fled as a new player stepped onto the stage.",
		"  ...But from where would it enter?",
		"  The sound of footsteps, a nostalgic parade, approached.",
		"\"No... No way...\"",
		"  Unfortunately it was true.",
		"  This was a miracle that Aoko Aozaki, an apprentice mage, had never witnessed.",
		"  The dead came to life.",
		"  The inanimate awakened.",
		"  The woods were enveloped by the mists.",
		"  Fire-breathing lizards lurked in the swamps.",
		"  Puppets made merry at midnight.",
		"  Alice Kuonji's slender fingers had transfigured the entirety of the park, as if gently stroking the back of an elderly cat.",
		"    \"Very well...",
		" Let us play pretend, Aoko.\"",
		"  For one night, the wasteland of dashed hopes and dreams was restored to its former glory.",
		"  It was an immortal monster ready to devour reality-",
		"  a dark fairy tale that, once unleashed, would never let its prey escape.",
		"\"Run if you dare.",
		"  I don't believe you'll get far, but if you can survive the night, I'll concede this round to you.\"",
		"  Her declaration marked the start of a desperate battle.",
		"  The witch in black laughed at her friend,",
		"  her musical mirth filled with affection, sadness, and innocent delight.",
		"  But hope was something ever fleeting.",
		"  It lasted not even three hundred meters.",
		"  The edge of the amusement park may well have been the edge of the world.",
		"  Dozens of undulating horizons could be seen,",
		"  crowding the sky like a giant cloud, or a thick curtain,",
		"  or perhaps, groaning lips.",
		"  It was the end of the road, the outer limit of an outrageous and fantastical realm.",
		"  And yet...",
		"  Aoko found it to be much like the last page of an enormous picture book.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  The sight turned her mind blank.",
		"  \"Well, this is about as bad as it gets,\" she thought.",
		"  The Snark―this island of despair―had at last brought Aoko to her knees as she stared at the swelling border.",
		"  The park indeed had an end.",
		"  Even now as Aoko and Soujuurou had expected it to be, a fence divided the amusement park from the residential area neighboring it.",
		"  It had both doubled in height and been made sturdier, another hurdle she had foreseen before even laying eyes on it.",
		"  Expecting it to have been Snarkified, Aoko had come prepared to demolish an obstacle or two.",
		"  But this...",
		"  This construction before her went far beyond a mere wall.",
		"  It was an ocean that separated the underworld from the mortal one.",
		"  The iron fence was like a restless, surging sea.",
		"  One or two walls could easily be toppled.",
		"  Even ten or twenty could be dealt with one way or another.",
		"  Between the power left in her body and that which filled the park, putting on a brave front was within her power. She could fully mobilize her circuits and her crest to the point of burnout in a last-ditch effort, like some reenactment of the parting of the Red Sea.",
		"\"But then that would be it.\"",
		"  Even if a path could be opened, she would not have the energy left to walk it.",
		"  And it was obvious what would become of her afterward.",
		"  The residents would hardly forgive her for wreaking such havoc around their park. Like ants drawn to honey, they would swarm the helpless girl and tear her to pieces.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Despondent and exhausted, she felt the faint sting of remorse.",
		"  Escaping the park...",
		"  Looking back on how they had gotten here, Aoko recognized that her choices had been her undoing.",
		"  Under the golden full moon, beams of steel bent and merged like wire-frame sculptures.",
		"  It was only a matter of time before the amusement park itself became one colossal monster.",
		"  The horde of familiars, gathered in the plaza where Alice was, had formed an impenetrable blockade around her.",
		"  Just above the head of the boy beside her, the whispering egg―called Scratch Dumpty―continued to shuffle what appeared on its surface.",
		"\"Aozaki!\"",
		"\"Shizuki?\"",
		"  The boy's voice snapped Aoko out of her trance.",
		"  If only for a moment.",
		"  The stark reality of the situation quickly dawned on the novice mage―",
		"  the sheer hopelessness of it all, as it ripped out and snatched away any will she had to resist.",
		"\"Let's head for the gate. It's hopeless here, but we might have a chance at the entrance.",
		"  That Flat Snark thing. You said it has its own set of rules to follow, right?",
		"Then, we need to think about the basics. The fence would have been impassable from the start, but the gate might still work as an entrance and exit.\"",
		"  Soujuurou had not given in to panic.",
		"  Aoko found herself honestly admiring Soujuurou's ability to analyze Snark's characteristics, given the circumstances.",
		"  Now calm, she steeled her resolve.",
		"\"You're right. The gate is a good option.",
		"  But just getting there will be a challenge. Even the weakest enemies, those loaves, are becoming hard to deal with.",
		"  Plus, the best of her familiars are just going to keep gathering at the plaza and the entrance. I mean, the gate itself might be a monster even worse than the Ferris wheel. It's designed to look like a giant Kitsy.\"",
		"\"So you're not going to the front gate?\"",
		"\"Nah. We have a better chance over here.\"",
		"\"...?\"",
		"  Aoko took another glance at the undulating iron fences.",
		"  It was too late to achieve their goal of making it out alive.",
		"  In that case, she decided to prioritize the other promise she had made.",
		"\"I'm gonna go ahead and break down the fences here. You have to escape once you see an opening.",
		"  Then my job will be done.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Though her words were few, her tone told the whole story.",
		"  She was telling him to escape by himself.",
		"\"It's not possible.",
		"  You can't destroy them by yourself, Aozaki.\"",
		"\"If I were by myself, you'd be right. But right now the park is actually helping me. With this much fuel, all I need to do is aim and pull the trigger. All it needs is one good blast.",
		"  That said, I'll only be able to do it once, so as soon as I open a hole, I need you to run like your life depends on it.\"",
		"  She would carve a path through this iron sea of fences,",
		"  gambling on one final effort―a great incantation to launch a massive projectile that pushed her limits to the extreme.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  As an outsider, Soujuurou could not even begin to imagine just how much of a burden this would be for her. All he could imagine was a hazy vision of Aoko being left behind in this park.",
		"  What would happen to her?",
		"  Would that girl in black come to save her?",
		"  Cruel as it was to imagine, he knew she would not.",
		"  After Aoko had exhausted her very best in order to save him, that girl would not stay her hand.",
		"  The only way Alice would let Aoko off the hook was if Aoko killed Soujuurou as payment.",
		"  And so...",
		"\"Get back about fifteen meters.",
		"It'll take time to cast, but I'll make sure to finish this before that egg gets hardboiled.\"",
		"  It went without saying that this was the only path.",
		"\"Wait. I want to know.",
		"  Is there even a point to letting me go?\"",
		"\"None. Even once you get out, there's no way you'll be able to escape Alice forever.",
		"But I'm stubborn to the very end. I said I'd protect you, so I'm damn well going to do my best to keep you alive.\"",
		"  Surprised by her seemingly moral stance, Soujuurou saw Aoko in a new light.",
		"  ...Ah. But of course.",
		"  Soujuurou realized that she was not fighting for his sake, but for the sake of her pride.",
		"\"...Right. I guess you did say that.",
		"  But it's not like you to let me go by myself.\"",
		"\"Oh, give me a break! Just move already!\"",
		"  For some reason, Aoko took a step away from him.",
		"  She was recalling how, an hour ago, he had gotten the better of her.",
		"\"Aozaki. If you're still willing to fight, then let's do it some other way.",
		"  If you can destroy that monster of a fence, then let's put your power to better use.\"",
		"\"There isn't anything else I can do! Sorry, but all I can do is destroy what I can see. Dying for some forlorn hope isn't how I want to go out.",
		"Don't you get it? The fact is, blowing this thing up to let you slip out is all I can manage. I can't beat Flat Snark, or anything else. It's the least I can do after―\"",
		"\"So you're going to run from this responsibility, too?\"",
		"  Aoko was just about to turn her back on him when Soujuurou clutched her hand.",
		"  His words caused something inside of her to boil with rage.",
		"  It was as though someone had set her heart on fire.",
		"  The surprise that pricked open her true feelings and the disappointment she felt toward herself thawed her frozen limbs.",
		"\"Why you...! Don't get it backward! I'M the one letting YOU escape, not the other way around! I'll blow the whole damn park if I feel like it, just you watch!\"",
		"\"Okay. In that case, it'd be a waste to help me escape right now.",
		"Save that move for when you really mean it. I'll give you a hand until then.\"",
		"\"Huh?! YOU help ME?! Talk about a waste of time!",
		"  Now you're really pissing me off. Just get out of here, you dimwit! What use do I have for a dunce whose special power is running himself ragged?!\"",
		"\"I may be pretty exhausted,",
		"but you're in worse shape, Aozaki. Just look at yourself. You're tired and injured.\"",
		"  Not to mention the injury to her back that Aoko had  nearly forgotten about.",
		"  Even now, she couldn't ignore the pain that automaton had inflicted on her spine.",
		"  With iron will, she'd managed to push it out of her mind. Mostly.",
		"\"Even without any of that magecraft stuff I'm still in better shape than you are. I could probably even carry you all the way to the entrance if I needed to.\"",
		"\"Don't make promises you can't keep.",
		"  Just... go. I'm used to this, and you're not. This is your first time facing this sort of thing, right?",
		"  So, it's okay.\"",
		"  The fact that they were a team...",
		"  The fact that she would still have to kill him after all of this...",
		"  None of the irony was lost on her as she said these words.",
		"  Because none of it mattered anymore.",
		"  Still, Soujuurou didn't let go of her hand.",
		"  He gripped it even harder.",
		"  His expression was the same as ever. Aoko frowned, trying to figure out if he was upset with her.",
		"\"You're right, this is my first time with this sort of thing.",
		"  But I've experienced my own fair share of danger in the mountains. I've even been attacked by a deer, you know.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  As a city girl, she had no idea what it meant to be attacked by a deer, but his determination was apparent enough.",
		"  True...",
		"  Looking back on it now, he had maintained his composure through it all.",
		"  A normal person would barely be able to talk through such panic.",
		"  Perhaps growing up deep in the mountains, far from civilization, had taught him how to stay calm in the face of so much.",
		"\"So trust me. Just a little.\"",
		"  He spoke his plain, unadulterated feelings,",
		"  and released his hand.",
		"  There was no lie in him.",
		"  In fact, he was too honest; so much so that she found it hard to believe him.",
		"  Soujuurou had no reason to go that far.",
		"  As it stood, Aoko had no future.",
		"  After confessing this and telling him to escape, why did this boy still offer to help a person like her?",
		"\"I don't understand. Why do all this?",
		"  You're going to die if you stay with me.",
		"This is it. This is your last chance. Think it through. You should be running.\"",
		"\"I know, but I'm not going anywhere.\"",
		"  Soujuurou answered immediately, realizing that Aoko was looking for his reason.",
		"  This level of insight in Soujuurou demanded a round of applause.",
		"\"If I do, you'll die, Aozaki.\"",
		"  His words were as irrational as always.",
		"\"But why?! Why do it? Why go so far for me?!\"",
		"  She was yelling out of frustration.",
		"  After thinking for a moment, Soujuurou replied.",
		"\"I guess it's because... I like you.\"",
		"  Simple and to the point.",
		"  His face seemed to ask why she would even question him so.",
		"  There was a pause, no more than two seconds.",
		"  His surprise attack had stopped Aoko in her tracks.",
		"  Alice was not the only one who had an ace up her sleeve.",
		"  That line reached deeper even than Flat Snark could ever hope to.",
		"  All Aoko could respond with was an expression of pure shock.",
		"  It was a simple, stubborn reason. The strongest kind on Earth.",
		"\"...Ugh.\"",
		"  Soujuurou Shizuki was indeed incomprehensible, to be able to work unconditionally with someone who was trying to kill him.",
		"  But she felt as though she'd finally grasped a sliver of his true nature.",
		"  Tobimaru and the others' assessment of him was correct...",
		" ...as vexing as it was to her to admit.",
		"\"Even though I can't stand you... You sure are a dip, you know.\"",
		"  He laughed at her sour grumbling. At this point, he was used to her insults.",
		"  Their clash of wills ended here.",
		"  Aoko's blood ran hot from her blazing heart.",
		"  If he was going to make a face like that, all she could do was try to think of a way to get them both home.",
		"\"Running away isn't really my thing, anyway.",
		"  Fine. I'll stick it out to the end. And if you're going to stay with me, Shizuki, I'm sure we can find some way for you to help.\"",
		"  Though her tone had lightened, there was still hesitation in her eyes.",
		"  It was only natural. Aoko had not even a clue as to how to begin to fight the Snark.",
		"  If only she had been just a bit more skilled, or had trained just a bit more, there might have been some way to look for it.",
		"\"I'm better than this. If only I had a way to peel back its true form.\"",
		"  Without realizing, she let her apprehension show.",
		"  Whining was pointless.",
		"  She would just have to figure it out by herself, but―",
		"\"Hmm? What, that's all we need to figure out?\"",
		"\"Huh?\"",
		"  Aoko gave him a look, as if to ask what *that* was supposed to mean.",
		"\"I mean, you asked me earlier to look for something weird, right?\"",
		"  Soujuurou also made a face that suggested she should have brought it up sooner.",
		"\"Wait, you know what it is?!\"",
		"\"I think so. Well, I've been wondering about it for a while, actually.\"",
		"  Soujuurou whispered in her ear quietly, so as not to be overheard.",
		"\"...Ah.\"",
		"  It was certainly unexpected,",
		"  but then again, equally obvious. After he explained the mistake, she knew right away that he was correct.",
		"  At last, she had an inkling of Flat Snark's original form. Namely...",
		"  They strategized for ten minutes.",
		"  After deliberation regarding the Snark's true form and figuring a plan of attack, the two exchanged nods in acceptance of their roles.",
		"\"We'll be splitting up now.",
		"  Just don't make it a repeat of the blunder in the house of mirrors. You're the crux of this operation. If you bungle the start even a little, there's no coming back from this one.\"",
		"  Though she jabbed him for his previous failure as a decoy, her voice was bright.",
		"  Aoko's original vigor had returned to her at Soujuurou's discovery of the truth.",
		"  Meanwhile, Soujuurou was also getting serious in his own way.",
		"  He took Aoko's warning to heart.",
		"\"Good. But remember that our positions are reversed this time.",
		"  If we fail, I'm not the one who's going to die, it's you. I won't be there to clean up your mess, so watch your step.\"",
		"\"I know. After all this, I regret what not taking your advice earlier. I'll be careful.\"",
		"  Soujuurou nodded, telling her to leave it to him. Though he made it sound like he was holding a grudge, it seemed to him to be the only way of showing her his resolve.",
		"  Aoko let out a sigh of defeat. Once more, she couldn't figure him out.",
		"\"Seriously, I can't tell if you're a big idiot or a big hero.",
		"  Whichever one it is, I'm counting on you. Don't let me down.\"",
		"  She had wanted to say that she believed in him, but apparently that was too embarrassing for her.",
		"  Aoko turned away from Soujuurou and began to run.",
		"  She had begun to think that maybe this change of pace was not so bad after all.",
		"  And so ended the intermission.",
		"  The young cast were handed their new lines.",
		"  But what of the climax?",
		"  At long last, this night of witches had entered its climax."
