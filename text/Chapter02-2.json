		"「静希君、いる？」",
		"　昼休みも終わろうとしている十二時五十分。",
		"　一向に活気の<衰|おとろ>えない二年Ｃ組の教室に顔を出し、",
		"　……彼女にとってはごく普通の仕草で……",
		"　蒼崎青子はそう告げた。",
		"　青子にとってＣ組は<余所|よそ>のクラスだが、そんな事はおかまいなしで気軽に教室へと入っていく。",
		"　一方。リラックスした彼女とは対照的に、今まで餌を前にした<雛鳥|ひなどり>の如く騒がしかった生徒達は白々しいほど静かに、行儀よく席につきはじめた。",
		"『……どういう意味よ、それ……』",
		"　内心で舌打ちしつつ、青子は教室を見回した。",
		"　目当ての男子生徒の姿はない。",
		"　目立たない奴だから、はじっこに隠れているかと思えばそうでもなさそうだ。",
		"「有里君。出席番号12番の静希君は？」",
		"　青子はあくまで事務的に問う。",
		"「え、俺……？　えーと、静希ならさっき鳶丸<殿下|でんか>が連れていったよ」",
		"　名前を呼ばれた男子生徒は、青子が自分の名前を知っている事に驚きつつ返答した。",
		"　余談ではあるが、<槻司|つきじ><鳶丸|とびまる>が殿下と呼ばれるのは彼が理事長の息子だから……という訳でもなく、純粋に彼の振るまいが王子のようだからである。",
		"　本人もそのアダ名は気に入っているらしい。",
		"「鳶丸が……？　あいつ、静希君と仲いいの？」",
		"　意外そうに訊く青子と、",
		"　その台詞を意外そうに聞くクラス一同。",
		"「良いも悪いも、槻司くんが男子と仲良く話してるのって今まで見たことなかったよ、あたし達。",
		"　あ、木乃美くんはバカだから別だけど」",
		"「そうだよなあ。はじめは殿下もあんまり話してなかったけど、三日もしたら楽しそうに口喧嘩してたもんなぁ」",
		"「ま、静希相手につっぱっても仕方ないじゃん？　あいつ変だけどいい奴だし」",
		"「そーよねー。いい人だもんねー草十郎くん！」",
		"　調子を取り戻しつつあるのか、二年Ｃ組の面々はざわざわと会話をリレーしはじめる。",
		"　それをしばらく聞いていた青子だったが、唐突にくるりと背を向け、",
		"「それじゃ」と二年Ｃ組を後にした。",
		"　とりあえず手短に、草十郎の話は済んだ。",
		"　昼休みも残り数分と迫った生徒会室。",
		"　話し終えて満足顔の草十郎と、",
		"　聞き終わって難色顔の鳶丸が、机をはさんで向かいあっている。",
		"「さ、感想を聞かせてくれ」",
		"　話す事はすべて話した、と草十郎。",
		"　鳶丸はというと、怒っているような、悩んでいるような、曖昧な表情で額に指を当てていた。",
		"「……なあ、草の字。おまえ、人を馬鹿にできるほど器用な奴じゃねえよな」",
		"「失礼な。器用な方だぞ、俺は」",
		"　その返答に、つくづく不器用な性格だと確信する。",
		"　となると結論は二つに一つだ。",
		"　一つは、いま聞いた話は真実だという事。",
		"　あるいは、彼が幻覚を見るほど疲れきっているという事。",
		"　鳶丸としては後者であってほしいものだが……。",
		"「……草十郎。率直に言って、俺はおまえが気に入っている。",
		"　嘘のない人間なんてのは人間じゃねえ。",
		"俺は人間嫌いだから、そんなおまえさんが気に入ってたりするんだが……",
		"そんなヤツまでバカげたコトを言い出したら、俺は明日から何を頼りに昼メシを食えばいいんだ？」",
		"「学食で食べればいいんじゃないか？」",
		"　あっさりとした一言に、鳶丸はいっそう表情を暗くする。",
		"「分かった、はっきり言おう。それは幻覚だ。",
		"　幽霊の正体見たり<枯|か>れ<尾花|おばな>ってヤツだろうさ。それでも納得いかないってんなら、いい精神科を紹介してやる」",
		"「それが君の感想か。よし、ならいいんだ」",
		"　聞きようによっては侮辱としか取れない鳶丸の言葉を、草十郎は<泰然|たいぜん>と受けとめた。",
		"「そりゃあ俺だって神隠しの<類|たぐい>だと思ったよ。",
		"　けど、都会じゃもしかしてそれも有りなのかもしれないだろ。確かめたかったのはそこなんだ」",
		"　良かった、とばかりに草十郎は残った最後の握り飯をぺろっと平らげ、包み布をたたむ。",
		"「……おい。すると何か？",
		"　おまえは都会の人間は口から火を吹いたり、腕が伸びたりするのが普通だと思ったのか？」",
		"「……まあ、普通じゃないけど、特別でもないんじゃないかと思ったんだ。",
		"　ここは山に無い物があふれている、何でもありの場所だ。だから、それぐらいやってのける人だって、もしかしているのかなと」",
		"　真顔で返す草十郎を見て、鳶丸は自分と彼を<隔|へだ>てている文化レベルの違いを痛感した。",
		"　電気も通わない山奥。",
		"　夜は太古のままの夜で、人間は主役ではなくどうでもいい端役、自然を構築する一パーツに留まっているのなら、たしかに、この少年のような人間が出来るのだろう。",
		"　赤子が無垢なまま成長したと言えば聞こえはいいが、要は人が少なすぎて文明が発達するまでもなかった、",
		"　あるいは、余分な知識体系を必要としなかった素朴な世界だったのだ。",
		"　都会の生活を“今までの生活では全てありえなかった事”と感じる彼だからこそ、逆説的に、“起こりえる事は全てありえる事”に取ってしまう。",
		"「安心しろ。たしかにこっちには<性質|たち>の悪いヤツらばっかりだけどな、そんな魔法使いみたいなヤツはいねえよ」",
		"「そうだと良いんだけど」",
		"　どこか納得のいかない様子の草十郎。",
		"　……確かに、今の話の中で納得のいかない点は鳶丸にもあった。",
		"アリかナシかはともかくとして、いま聞かされた出来事は人道的によろしくない。",
		"「まあ、事の真偽というか、どんな間違いでそう見えたかは置いておいてだ。",
		"　結果だけ見ればうちの生徒が夜の公園で人を殺したって事になる。しかも双方控えめに表現しても普通じゃねえ」",
		"　町にやってきて日の浅い草十郎は、同い年の少年少女は『みなこの学校の生徒である』と誤認していたのだが、幸か不幸か結論として間違いではなかった。",
		"「一人は火炎放射器を持って、もう一人は……",
		"まあ、なんだ。<長刀|なぎなた>でも持ち出したのか、刃物らしきものが何メートルも伸びたときた」",
		"　鳶丸の呆れ声を聞きながら、なるほど、と小さく頷く草十郎。こうして<他人|ひと>の口から聞くと、相手を馬鹿にしてるとしか思えない内容だ。",
		"「正気を疑うな。尋常じゃないぞ、その話」",
		"「草十郎。おまえ、実は俺をからかってんだろう？」",
		"「いや、まったく。",
		"　けどまあ、都会にはそんな人間はいないんだろう？",
		"　なら鳶丸の言う通り、夢でも見てたんだ。ここのところアルバイトと試験が重なって辛くて」",
		"　今は冬休み直前。期末試験は一週間後に迫っている。草十郎にとっては何よりも手強い難敵だ。",
		"「俺は基本ができてないから、人の倍程度の勉強じゃ追いつけない。ほら、勉強ばかりしているとノイローゼをするんだろう？」",
		"「そりゃするんじゃなくてなるものだが、ま、なんにせよやり過ぎ飲み過ぎはよくねえわな。試験前ぐらいはバイト減らしたらどうだ？」",
		"「減らしてはいるんだけどね。年末ってアルバイトを休む人も多くて、その代行も頼まれがちだし」",
		"　草十郎はやれやれと肩をすくめる。",
		"　その口ぶりから彼の忙しさは読み取れる。",
		"　ノイローゼはともかく、睡眠不足で白昼夢を見るぐらいあるかもしれない。……実際、その場面にでくわしたのは深夜とのコトではあるが。",
		"「なんだか大変そうだな、草十郎」",
		"「ああ、実はかなりまいってる。都会の暮らしは深刻だ」",
		"　困ったもんだと真顔で頷く草十郎。",
		"　毛ほども疲れていないように見えるのが困りものだった。",
		"「泣き言いわねえのは感心するけどな。",
		"　おまえ、心労は顔に出ない<性質|タチ>か？」",
		"「？　そりゃ、心労はどこも痛まないからね」",
		"　答えて、草十郎はちらりと壁の時計を見る。",
		"　そろそろ昼休みも終わろうとしていた。",
		"「鳶丸、時間だ」",
		"「お？　ああ、もうそんなに経ったか。気にせず先に行ってていいぜ。俺はまだ用があるからよ」",
		"　生徒会役員は大変なんだとジェスチャーする鳶丸を、草十郎はマジマジと見つめる。",
		"　価値の分からない美術品を見るような目で。",
		"「授業をさぼれる身分っていうのは羨ましいな。",
		"　そういうの、鳶丸が嫌いな手抜きじゃないのか？」",
		"「そりゃ誤解も<甚|はなは>だしい！　俺の欠席は手抜きじゃねえ、特権ってヤツだと言ったろう!?」",
		"　心外だ、とばかりに席を立って力説する副会長。",
		"　それをふーん、と無感動に眺める転入生。",
		"「おいおい、アレだけ説明したのにぜんっぜん分かってなかったのか!?",
		"　しょうがねえ、まず座れ。いいか草の字。",
		"　常人をうわまわる英気と幸運を兼ね備えながら、座する事なく精進してきた俺でも、ここを卒業しちまえば裸一貫になっちまうんだぞ？」",
		"「ひでえ話だ。",
		"　<自分|テメエ>の家柄を活用できんのはあと一年ちょいだけなんだぜ？　これの一体どこが羨ましいってんだ？",
		"　ふつう一生続くはずの親の七光って<権利|ヤツ>が、俺の場合はたった三年間しかねえんだからな！」",
		"「となりゃあ、有効なうちに使っておかなきゃもったいなくてオチオチ眠ってもいられねえ。",
		"　ああイヤだイヤだ、何がイヤかってバカどもと<雁首|がんくび>ならべて金勘定するのがイヤだ！　ったく、嫉妬渦巻く大人の世界じゃ俺のオブラートみたいな心なんてぱっくり呑まれて溶けちまうコト請け合いだろうさ！」",
		"「――――――」",
		"　冗談にしか取れない熱弁は、草十郎の聞くかぎりどうも本気のようだった。",
		"　そういう事を本気で言える人間性が羨ましい、などと思いつつ、草十郎はなるほど、と納得する。",
		"　本人が言うのだから彼の主観的には正しいのだろうと。",
		"　だが、",
		"「あら、そんな権利なんて留年すればいくらでも引き延ばせるのに。なんなら協力してあげましょうか、この私でよろしければ」",
		"　草十郎の骨のない相づちを蹴散らすように、生徒会室の扉が勢いよく開かれた。",
		"　ほんわかした空気を一撃で打ち砕く<冷静|クール>な一言。",
		"　槻司鳶丸にあったこの場の支配権は、<蝙蝠|こうもり>より<潔|いさぎよ>く彼女の手に飛び立ったのだった。",
		"「……いや、いい。自分の夢は、自分の力だけで叶えようとつねづね思ってるんだ」",
		"「そ。なら今みたいな恥ずかしいこと力説しないでね。",
		"　廊下にまで聞こえてたわよ、副会長さん」",
		"　さらりと言って、彼女……蒼崎青子が生徒会室に入ってくる。",
		"　長い黒髪がわずかに乱れているのは、ここまで走ってきたせいか。",
		"　青子の視線は座ったままの草十郎にではなく、熱弁していた副会長に向けられている。",
		"「頑張れ、鳶丸」",
		"　そろそろ教室に戻らないといけない、と草十郎は静かに立ち上がる。",
		"「……わりと薄情なんだな、おまえって」",
		"　青子を前にして呟く鳶丸。",
		"「だって時間がない」",
		"「だから、そういうのが薄情とだな……」",
		"　言いかけて言葉を呑む鳶丸。",
		"　今まで自分しか見ていなかった青子の視線が、草十郎をちらりと見たからだ。",
		"「時間がないのは私も同じよ。貴方にはいつも振り回される」",
		"　これは文句ではなく、素直な意見らしい。",
		"「なんだ、用件は草十郎かよ」",
		"「安心なさい、貴方にもあるから」",
		"「……？」",
		"　心なしか、青子の目に殺伐とした<翳|かげ>りがある。",
		"　いつも不機嫌そうな青子の視線に見慣れている鳶丸だからこそ気づける、微妙な差異だ。",
		"　……理由は不明だが、蒼崎青子はいつになくご機嫌ななめという事らしい。",
		"「静希君。貴方、走るのと泳ぐの、どっちが好き？」",
		"　唐突に青子が訊ねる。",
		"　草十郎は少し顔を曇らせてから、どっちも、と答えた。",
		"「だめよ、ひとつにして」",
		"「……泳ぐほう、かな。けど、どうして？」",
		"「貴方がまだどこの部にも所属してないから」",
		"　実に無駄のない答えだった。",
		"　無駄がなさすぎて、草十郎の意見をはさむ隙間もない。",
		"「うちの校則、読んだわよね。生徒はただ一人の例外もなく部活動に参加しなくてはならない。",
		"　正直どうかと思う校則だけど、決まりは決まりだから」",
		"「そんな無茶な。悪いけど、そこまでの暇はないんだ」",
		"「でしょうね」",
		"　短い返答。",
		"　青子に容赦がないのはいつもの事だが、鳶丸には、彼女が草十郎との会話を避けているようにも見える。",
		"「――――――」",
		"「――――――」",
		"　無言で見つめあうふたり。",
		"　第三者の鳶丸すら息がつまりそうな沈黙は、そうか、という草十郎の一言で破られた。",
		"「蒼崎は分かってると思ってた。",
		"ああ、いや違う、きっと分かっているんだな。",
		"　うん。だから、そこが強いんだろうね」",
		"　席を離れる草十郎。",
		"　青子の横を通り過ぎ、あっさりと廊下に出る。",
		"「それ、明日からでいいんだろ？」",
		"「静希君がいいならね」",
		"　できるだけ頑張るよ、と苦笑して、草十郎は生徒会室を後にした。",
		"　そんな一連の出来事を観察しながら、鳶丸はつくづく草十郎に感心していた。",
		"　今の青子の態度は、相手を怒らせる事を前提としたものだ。しかし草十郎は怒りだす様子もなく、掴みどころのない……言ってるコトは本当に掴みようがなかったが……返答をして去っていった。",
		"　草十郎とて少なからず不満に思っただろう。",
		"　それを表情にも仕草にも出さなかった事に、鳶丸は一流の芸を見た気がしたのである。",
		"「いや、でも何が強いんだろうな会長？」",
		"　鳶丸は首をかしげて青子を見る。",
		"　青子は立ち尽くしたまま、じっと壁を睨んでいた。",
		"「……蒼崎？」",
		"　鳶丸の呼び掛けに、青子は応えない。",
		"「おーい、かいちょー。蒼崎ぃー。……青子女史？",
		"　……",
		"おい、聞いてんのかよ蒼崎青子！」",
		"「っさいわね！　あおあお呼ぶなっ！」",
		"　怒鳴り声が生徒会室に響く。",
		"　さきほどの鳶丸の熱弁以上に、廊下にまで通る美声だった。",
		"「やかましい、うるせえのはテメエも同じだ！」",
		"　よほど耳に響いたのか、それとも怒鳴られたら怒鳴り返す性分なのか、鳶丸も反射的に言い返す。",
		"「そんなんだから男の一人もできねえんだよ、おまえは。",
		"　ほら、目ぇ覚めたか？」",
		"「別に、貴方の声は聞こえてた。わずらわしかったから無視してただけよ。黙らせるの面倒だし」",
		"「テメエな。俺は蚊かなんかか、おい」",
		"「コミュニケーションが成立しない点で言えば、あっちのがまだ上品よね」",
		"「……ほう、その心は？」",
		"「お互い、何を言ってるか分からない。意味のない会話なら、逢瀬みたいなものでしょう？」",
		"「………………」",
		"　その論からいくと、彼女にとって恋人同士とは意味のない会話をするものらしい。",
		"「……問題は、おまえにとって意味のある会話ってのがどの程度の価値かってコトだが……まあいいか。",
		"　いつになくきついじゃねえか、蒼崎」",
		"「ちょっとね。いま愛嬌ふりまける状況じゃないのよ」",
		"「不思議だ。この二年間で蒼崎の愛嬌なんてものは見たことがないんだが」",
		"「鳶丸のいない時にふりまいてたの」",
		"「そうかよ。やっぱりあの時のこと恨んでるんだろ、生徒会長さんはよ」",
		"　鳶丸の言うあの時というのは一つしかない。",
		"　今年の夏に起きた、生徒会室イン武道館事件の事である。",
		"「え、随分と昔の話じゃないそれ？",
		"　そんなどうでもいい事に容量を使っちゃもったいないわよ？　ただでさえ脳の覚醒部分が少ないのに」",
		"　会話が走ってきたおかげか、青子から先ほどまでの<殺伐|さつばつ>さが薄れつつあった。鋭い視線も、時たまにしか見せない<涼|すず>しげなものになる。",
		"　学校内で彼女のこういった顔を見られるのは、今のところ槻司鳶丸だけだろう。",
		"「ご忠告どうも。俺だってあんな事は忘れてえよ。",
		"　……ただ、さっき草の字が馬鹿な事いいやがるからつい思い出しちまったんだよ。くそ、考えてみりゃあ場所まで一緒じゃねえか！」",
		"　などと悪態をつきながらも、まんざらでもなさげに過去を懐かしむ鳶丸。",
		"　一方、青子は顔をしかめる。",
		"「ちょっと待って。",
		"　あの話、彼にしたの……？」",
		"「おう、俺がテメエに",
		"“なんで会長になんか立候補したのよ。アンタは副会長って顔でしょ、どう見ても”",
		"　なんて挑発されて、生涯最高の突きをしたところまでな」",
		"　何故か、ほう、と青子は息をついた。その先を知られなくて良かった、という風に。",
		"　何故だかは鳶丸にも青子自身にも分からない。",
		"「アレはたしかに、びっくりするぐらいいい突きだった。",
		"　思わず体が反応しちゃったものね。",
		"　ところで、私そんなコト言ったっけ？」",
		"「言った。しかも俺が保健室に運ばれたのをこれ幸いと、強引に副会長にしやがった」",
		"　以来、鳶丸は選挙戦で負けた相手に副会長として使われているのであった。",
		"「いいけどな。俺に会長職は合わねえって分かったし。副会長の方が性に合ってやがる。会長なんてやってたら、あやうく親父みたいな野郎になってただろうしよ」",
		"「プライド高い分、できるコトは全部やるからね鳶丸は。",
		"　ま、会長職に専心するあまり、気が付いたら優等生になってたアンタも見たかったけど？」",
		"「やめてくれ、ゾッとしねえ。",
		"　ネコかぶるのはおまえだけで十分だ」",
		"　しっしっ、と青子に手を振る鳶丸。",
		"　男女にあるまじき戦いを繰り広げた者特有の、実にさっぱりした<罵|ののし>り合いだった。",
		"「―――で。",
		"なんでそんな話したのよ」",
		"「は？」",
		"「半年前の、ここの事件を、なんで彼に話したのよ」",
		"「あ、そっちか。",
		"　いや、あいつが馬鹿なこと口走ったからなんだが―――」",
		"　その先は言えない。",
		"　静希草十郎が蒼崎青子に惚れている、という事実は口に出来ない事だ。<漢|おとこ>としての暗黙の了解である。",
		"　たとえ、それが彼の勘違いでもだ。",
		"「それより、さっきのはないんじゃねえのか蒼崎。",
		"　おまえ、草十郎に恨みでもあんの？」",
		"「七日以上前の恨みを引きずるほど、私はお姫さまじゃないつもりだけど」",
		"　ああ、おまえはお姫さまっていうより女王さまだな、と言いかけて止める鳶丸。",
		"　彼もこの二年で、十分に蒼崎青子を学習しているのだった。",
		"「恨みはないねえ。それにしちゃあ故意にケンカ売ってただろ。なんでだ？",
		"　たしかに調子の狂うヤツだが、あいつほどいいヤツはいねえだろうに」",
		"「――――――」",
		"「おい待て。なんだその、足下の白アリを見るかのような態度は」",
		"「別に。アンタまでその台詞を言うのかって、心底から見下げ果てただけよ」",
		"「……まあいいか。いいヤツ、いいひと、結構じゃない？　ケンカを売る相手としちゃあ上等だわ。誰も憎んであげないなら、私ぐらいそうしないとね」",
		"　うん、と気を取り直して気軽に言う青子。",
		"「しないとねって、おまえ」",
		"　鳶丸にはその結論がさっぱりである。",
		"　蒼崎青子のこういう思考の飛び方に慣れてはいる鳶丸だが、理由もなく嫌われる草十郎があんまりと言えばあんまりで、脳裏にはあの人畜無害な顔が浮かんでしまい、つい、",
		"「けど草十郎は蒼崎が好きなんだぜ。それでも嫌いなのか？」",
		"　二分足らずで、言うべきではないという誓いを破っていた。",
		"「あ―――いや、今のはな、蒼崎」",
		"　しまった、と口を閉ざすがもう遅い。",
		"　そして閉まったものは仕方がない。",
		"こうなると青子の反応に一縷の望みをかける鳶丸だが―――",
		"「そりゃそうでしょ、好き嫌いは誰にもあるし。",
		"　けどこればかりはね。彼が私と仲良くしたいって言っても、私は嫌いなんだから仕方ない」",
		"　ドライと言えばドライ。",
		"　スマートと言えばスマートな青子の感想に、柄にもなく憤慨してしまうのだった。",
		"「いや、そんなお友達感覚の話じゃなくてだな！",
		"　そういう好き嫌いじゃなくて、草の字は本気でおまえに惚れてるって言ったんだよ！」",
		"　真顔で怒鳴る鳶丸。",
		"　それに、青子はぽかんとした顔を向けていた。",
		"　まっさらなその顔は、何時間か前に財布を落とした、と気付いた放心に似ている。",
		"　なんでこんな<現実|コト>になってるのか、と我を疑う一瞬の間。",
		"　それは本当に一瞬で、",
		"「で？」",
		"　何でもないコトのように、平然と青子は聞き返した。",
		"　それが、一体、私にどんな意味があるのかと。",
		"「で？　ときたか。鬼でもなけりゃ悪魔だな、おまえって女は。よかろう、聞こえなかったのならもう一度言ってやる」",
		"　こうなったら漢の約束もあったもんじゃない、と開き直る鳶丸。",
		"「いいわよそんなの。つまらないもの」",
		"　それをあっさりと、心底からの感想で彼女は切り捨てた。",
		"「………………」",
		"　とりあえず、学校中のいまだ健気に片思いをしている男子生徒のため、この悪鬼に相応しい呼称はないかと模索する鳶丸だった。",
		"「なるほどね、それでさっきの話に結びつくワケだ。",
		"　へぇー、柄にもなく友達思いじゃない殿下？",
		"　ってコトは聞くも無惨、語るも無情っていう私の噂話、教えてあげたんでしょう？」",
		"　ふふ、と妖しい笑みを浮かべる青子。",
		"　鳶丸はこの相手に色恋ざたの話をした事を、どっかにいる神さまに懺悔した。",
		"「鳶丸にしちゃあ正しい判断ね。誉めてあげるから、どんな話をしたのか聞きたいなー、私」",
		"　笑顔のくせに殺気を放つのは止めてほしい。",
		"「……代表作と、ここでの事件を二つばかり」",
		"　遠慮がちな鳶丸の返答を聞いて、満足げに頷く青子。",
		"「こういう時、噂話って便利よね。うるさいのを追っ払ってくれるから。でも、そんな話を考えなしで広めたら大変だから、これからは気をつけてね」",
		"　それは、語尾にハートマークでもつきそうな、ゾッとするほど甘い笑顔だった。",
		"　怒りにしろ喜びにしろ、感情がハイになると蒼崎は可愛らしい口調になる……",
		"　そんな新事実を発見した鳶丸だが、だからといってこの場がどうにかなる訳でもない。",
		"「ああ、俺も命は惜しいからな、口はもう滑らねえよ。",
		"　……けどよ蒼崎。本気で草十郎が嫌いなのか？」",
		"　もうこの話題は避けるべきだと分かっていても<果敢|かかん>に挑む鳶丸。",
		"　男の友情というものは、時に真珠より美しい。",
		"「まあ……好きじゃないから嫌い、っていうワケじゃないけど。私が彼の事を嫌う理由は自分でも分からない。",
		"　だからダメなのね、きっと」",
		"　鳶丸の顔を立てていくらか思考実験したのか、青子はしばし悩んでからそんな返答をする。",
		"　即答ではなく熟考しての答えなら、鳶丸も文句を言う筋合いはない。",
		"「そうか。ま、そういうコトならしょうがねえか。",
		"　なにしろきれいさっぱり感情論だ。お互い理由もなく好きと嫌いじゃ手を貸す隙間もねえワケだし」",
		"　これでこの話は終わりか、と草十郎に謝りながら天をあおぐ鳶丸。",
		"　しかし。",
		"　その降参を告げる一言が、蒼崎青子の興味を引いたらしい。",
		"「……待って。今の、どういう意味？」",
		"　上機嫌ぽかった口調が変わる。",
		"　それに気付かず、軽い気持ちで鳶丸は答えた。",
		"「いやアイツもさ、蒼崎に惚れた理由が分からない、なんて言いやがってよ。……ああ、違ったか、理由なんてない、なんて意味だったかな」",
		"　鳶丸は“青子の外見に惹かれた”なんて草十郎の言葉を信じていないので、そこはあっさりと切り離す。",
		"「理由はない、ですって……？」",
		"「ああ。なんで、俺がいくらおまえの噂話をしても無駄だった。あまつさえなんて言ってたかな……そうそう、理由はどうあれ、蒼崎の心配は本物なんだ、とか、自分はそれで助かってるとか。俺なんかにゃ言えない台詞だったのは確かだね、どーにも。",
		"　はっきりしてんのは他の野郎どもと違って、噂を聞いても手を引く素振りなんざ微塵もなかったって事だけ―――」",
		"　そこまで調子よく語って、鳶丸は青子の変化に気が付いた。",
		"　彼女は壁を睨んでいる。",
		"　その、仇を見るような視線は無言のまま何分か続けられた。",
		"「……なにそれ。さっきといいそれといい、どこかで聞いたような事ばっかり―――」",
		"　ぎり、と歯を噛む音がする。",
		"　反感ここに極まり、あまりの不機嫌さに目の前にいる鳶丸が視界に入っていないようだ。",
		"　なんか、また絶望的に草十郎に迷惑かける事を言っちまったな、と鳶丸は天をあおいだ。",
		"「……少し分かったわ。なんでアイツが気に喰わないのか」",
		"　聞きたくない、どっかよそで喋ってくれないもんかなー、などと目を逸らす鳶丸を無視して、青子は<呪詛|じゅそ>のように言葉を紡ぐ。",
		"「あいつ、私が嫌いな奴と言動が似てるのよ。",
		"　誰彼かまわずいい人扱いされるところとか。妙にふわふわしてるところとか。いちいち私の癇に障るところとか」",
		"　最後のはただの八つ当たりだよな、と所在なげに時計とか見てみる副会長。",
		"　―――と。",
		"　時計は、当然のように午後一時を回っていた。",
		"「……分かった、もういい。この話をした俺が悪かった。",
		"　で、俺に用ってのはなんだよ。言っとくけど、もう授業始まってるぜ？」",
		"「へ？　授業って、なんで？　",
		"いつ？」",
		"「いや、さっき草の字が出てってから、蒼崎がぎらーんって壁睨んでた時にチャイムが鳴ったんだよ。いいのか生徒会長。五時限目ばっくれて」",
		"「っ、いいわけないでしょ！",
		"　なんで黙ってんのよアンタはーっ！」",
		"　鳶丸のネクタイをひっぱりながら、半泣き状態で青子は怒鳴る。",
		"対して、鳶丸は両手をギブアップの形で上げていた。勝者の余裕である。",
		"「蚊のほうがエレガントなんて言いやがった仕返しだ。",
		"　思い知るがいい、男の純情を踏みにじったり焼き殺したりするエリート悪魔め」",
		"「あいかわらず細かく根に持つ男！",
		"　言動には言動で返しなさいよね、卑怯者！」",
		"　鳶丸の首にぐいぐいとネクタイが締まっていく。",
		"　それすら勝者の愉悦、とチンピラ顔で笑う副会長。",
		"「ふふふ、おまえの古典が<補習|はめつ>に向かっているのは周知の事実。そしてＡ組の五時限目は言うまでもない。<藤代|ふじしろ>のばあさん、蒼崎のこと嫌ってるしな」",
		"　藤代というのは古参教師のひとりで、言うまでもなく、担当は古典である。",
		"「さあ、こんな所で俺のネクタイを引っぱる余裕があるのなら、急いで自分の教室に立ち返るがいい。",
		"　情けだ、別に止めはしねえよ」",
		"「っっっクソ、あんたなんかに嵌められるなんて！",
		"　えぇい、このまま死んでしまえ！」",
		"　さらに締まるネクタイ。",

		"\"Shizuki, you in here?\"",
		"  It was ten to twelve and lunchtime was quickly coming to an end.",
		"  Her face popped into Class C. As lively as ever,",
		"  as if it were an everyday occurrence...",
		"  ...Aoko Aozaki announced her presence.",
		"  While Aoko wasn't part of Class C, she didn't let it bother her as she casually entered the classroom.",
		"  In contrast, the baby birds who had been so noisily chirping while eating lunch quickly quieted and began to rearrange their seats.",
		"(Hmph. Are they trying to tell me something?)",
		"  She bristled internally before looking around the room.",
		"  She could not see the male student she had come here to find.",
		"  He hardly stood out, so she thought he might be hidden in a corner somewhere, but that appeared to not be the case.",
		"\"Arisato, do you have any idea where Shizuki from seat 12 is?\"",
		"  Aoko kept her tone professional.",
		"\"Wait, me? Umm, Shizuki left with His Highness Tobimaru a while ago.\"",
		"  The boy was shocked that she actually knew his name.",
		"  One might think that the reason students referred to Tobimaru Tsukiji by a royal title was because he was the chairman's son, but it was because he actually acted like royalty.",
		"  In fact, the vice-president was said to have taken a liking to the title.",
		"\"He's with Tobimaru? Are those two friends or something?\"",
		"  She seemed surprised.",
		"  The class seemed surprised at her surprise.",
		"\"No idea, but we've never seen Tsukiji be that friendly with another boy before.",
		"  Well, maybe Kinomi, but he's an idiot, so that hardly counts.\"",
		"\"Yeah. His Highness was slow to warm to him, but since the third day, it's been nothing but friendly arguments.\"",
		"\"Well, you can't really help but like Shizuki. He may be a little odd, but he's good people.\"",
		"\"Totally! Soujuurou is really nice!\"",
		"  Having recomposed themselves, Class C started chatting again.",
		"  Aoko listened for a bit before turning around",
		" and leaving the class with a, \"later.\"",
		"  All the Soujuurou talk finished as quickly as it had started.",
		"  Lunchtime was coming to a close in the student council room.",
		"  Soujuurou, having told his story, was smiling in satisfaction.",
		"  Tobimaru, still sitting across from him, was frowning.",
		"\"So, what do you think?\"",
		"  Soujuurou told his yarn as best he could.",
		"  Tobimaru fingered his brow as if he was angry or concerned.",
		"\"Sono-G. Are you trying to make fun of me? A word of advice, leave that to us smart people, hmm?\"",
		"\"Take that back. I'm more clever than you think.\"",
		"  His response only confirmed Tobimaru's suspicions.",
		"  It had to be one of two possible conclusions.",
		"  That what Soujuurou had just told him was true...",
		"  ...or that Soujuurou was so tired that he must have been hallucinating at the time.",
		"  Tobimaru sincerely hoped it was the latter.",
		"\"To be honest, Soujuurou. You're growing on me.",
		"  Anybody that never lies can't really be considered human.",
		"So for a misanthrope like me, I suppose you could say its easy to like you.",
		" But if you're gonna stick to your dumb story, I'm not sure what I'm going to do for lunch starting tomorrow.\"",
		"\"Why not just eat in the cafeteria?\"",
		"  Hearing his suggestion, Tobimaru's face darkened.",
		"\"Okay. I'll spell it out for you. You were hallucinating.",
		"  If you still insist you saw a ghost, I'd be more than happy to introduce you to a good psychiatrist.\"",
		"\"So that's your take on it. Good to know.\"",
		"  As bitter as Tobimaru's words might have sounded to most, Soujuurou swallowed them whole.",
		"\"I already figured as much. It sounds like a tall tale to me, too.",
		"  I was starting to wonder if it was normal for that kind of thing to go on in a city, so I wanted to hear your opinion.\"",
		"  Satisfied, Soujuurou finished off his last rice ball and neatly folded the cloth.",
		"\"Hey, hold on a second.",
		"  You didn't actually think it was normal for people in the city to breathe fire or extend their arms like they're made of rubber, did you?\"",
		"\"Well, not normal, as much as within the realm of possibility.",
		"  This city is full of extraordinary things we don't have up in the mountains. I thought it might have some extraordinary people as well.\"",
		"  That his face was as serious as it was made Tobimaru realize just how big a culture shock Soujuurou must've been experiencing.",
		"  Living up in the mountains, with no electricity.",
		"  In a place where the night sky was as it always had been, where humans were just one more organism in nature's garden. It makes sense that those conditions would create a boy like him.",
		"  The idea of children growing up so pure was an appealing one, but maybe it was natural to forgo civilization when your population was so small.",
		"  Or perhaps it was so simple a world that excessive knowledge was deemed irrelevant.",
		"  It was precisely because city life offered him so much that was impossible up till now that he had come to the conclusion that anything was possible here.",
		"\"Relax. The city might have its share of shady guys, but none of them are magicians in disguise.\"",
		"\"I hope you're right.\"",
		"  But Soujuurou seemed unsure.",
		"  And on Tobimaru's part, there were things to Soujuurou's story that he found hard to swallow.",
		"Whether true or not, the incident Soujuurou had described was disturbing.",
		"\"For the time being, let's assume what you say actually happened.",
		"  That would ultimately mean that one of our school's students killed someone in the park last night and that neither of the parties involved were... normal.\"",
		"  As a newcomer to town, Soujuurou assumed that everyone his age was a student at this school. For better or worse, he was right.",
		"\"One of them was equipped with a flamethrower, while the other...",
		" ...had a naginata... or at least a bladed weapon resembling one that was a good few meters in length.\"",
		"  Soujuurou bobbed his head up and down as he listened to the disbelief in Tobimaru's voice. Hearing it repeated by someone else, he could see how someone might think he was taking them for a ride.",
		"\"Look, I'm not crazy, it really did happen like I said.\"",
		"\"Give it to me straight, Soujuurou. You're pulling my leg, aren't you?\"",
		"\"No, I'm not.",
		"  But I get it. There's no one in the city who can do that...right?",
		"  If not, I was probably just hallucinating like you said. Working part-time while studying for exams has been pretty trying.\"",
		"  Winter break was just around the corner and the end of term exams were but a week away. Both were proving formidable opponents for Soujuurou.",
		"\"I don't even know the basics, so I need to study twice as hard as everyone else. I mean, anyone would start to lose it if they did nothing but study, right?\"",
		"\"I wouldn't say you're losing it, but you're definitely pushing yourself too hard. Maybe cut back on work a bit until the exams are over?\"",
		"\"I've tried to cut back, but a lot of people take off at the end of the year, so they often ask me to fill in for their shifts.\"",
		"  He shrugged helplessly.",
		"  It was obvious from his words that he had been busy.",
		"  Even if he was not going crazy, lack of sleep could have caused him to daydream, even if this all did go down in the middle of the night.",
		"\"Sounds tough, Soujuurou.\"",
		"\"Yeah, city life has been exhausting.\"",
		"  Soujuurou nodded with a pained look on his face.",
		"  What was strange, however, was that he did not look the least bit tired.",
		"\"I'm impressed you never complain about it.",
		"  You always look like nothing bothers you at all.\"",
		"\"Hm? That's just because it isn't bad enough to bother me.\"",
		"  As he answered, Soujuurou looked up at the clock on the wall.",
		"  Lunchtime was almost over.",
		"\"Tobimaru, the time.\"",
		"\"Really? It's that late already? You can go on ahead. I still have things to do.\"",
		"  Soujuurou watched as Tobimaru made a gesture that seemed to lament the life of a student council member.",
		"  His eyes looked as if they were looking at a piece of art and not understanding its value.",
		"\"I'm jealous that you can just skip class whenever you want.",
		"  I would have thought you were a stickler for the rules.\"",
		"\"How many times do I have to tell you?! It's not skipping when I've got special permission!\"",
		"  The vice-president angrily defended himself as he stood up.",
		"  The transfer student merely gazed at him, unfazed.",
		"\"Hey! You're not honestly implying you still don't understand after all that, are you?!",
		"  Oh well. Just sit down and listen, Sono-G.",
		"  I was granted talent and luck beyond that of most people, but I always put the work in. But once I leave here I'm on my own, now do you get it?\"",
		"\"I'm sick of explaining this to people.",
		"  My family's status will only keep me afloat for one more year. What about that could you possibly envy?",
		"  Most people can live off privilege for their entire lives, but the best I get is three measly years!\"",
		"\"So I have to take advantage of what I have while I have it.",
		"  Just the thought of having to count beans like the rest of the idiots out there gets me livid. The adult world is going to kill me. The envy alone will be enough to destroy my fragile heart!\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  While he must have been joking, Soujuurou took his tone to be completely sincere.",
		"  He listened as he envied Tobimaru's ability to be so open about his feelings.",
		"  From his frame of reference, there was nothing he could do but take Tobimaru for his word.",
		"  When...",
		"\"If you're looking to extend your privileges, why not stay in school? I'd be more than happy to arrange that for you.\"",
		"  The door to the student council room flew open, washing away Soujuurou's half-hearted responses to his friend.",
		"  This frosty statement destroyed the warm atmosphere of the room.",
		"  And it also marked the abrupt end to Tobimaru Tsukiji's reign there.",
		"\"...No, I just meant that our dreams are something we take hold of ourselves.\"",
		"\"Really. Then why not spend more time on that than this pathetic display.",
		"  I could hear you all the way from the hallway, Mr. Vice-President.\"",
		"  Not missing a beat, Aoko Aozaki stepped inside the room.",
		"  Her dark hair was slightly disheveled as if she had been running.",
		"  Her gaze missed the sitting Soujuurou entirely and was focused completely on the ranting vice-president.",
		"\"Good luck, Tobimaru.\"",
		"  Soujuurou quietly got up to head back to his classroom.",
		"\"...That's cold, man.\"",
		"  Tobimaru grumbled in front of Aoko.",
		"\"But it's almost time for class.\"",
		"\"You're just proving my point, you're-\"",
		"  He cut himself off.",
		"  Aoko briefly shifted her gaze to Soujuurou.",
		"\"It's not like I have time for this, either, you know. It feels like I'm always having to clean up after you.\"",
		"  Not a complaint. It was her honest opinion.",
		"\"Wait, you're here for Soujuurou?\"",
		"\"Don't worry. I'll deal with you next.\"",
		"\"...?\"",
		"  Her eyes shimmered with a murderous glee.",
		"  It was slightly different from the more sullen gaze to which Tobimaru had grown accustomed.",
		"  For whatever reason, Aoko's mood seemed worse than usual.",
		"\"Shizuki. Which do you prefer, running or swimming?\"",
		"  Aoko asked abruptly.",
		"  Soujuurou frowned a little before saying he was fine with either one.",
		"\"That won't do. Pick one.\"",
		"\"...Swimming, I guess. Why do you ask?\"",
		"\"Because you still haven't joined a club.\"",
		"  A succinct reply.",
		"  One that left no room for Soujuurou to object.",
		"\"You've read the school regulations. All students must participate in club activities.",
		"  I'm not the biggest fan of it myself, to be honest, but a rule is a rule.\"",
		"\"That's crazy. How could I possibly find the time for that?\"",
		"\"How indeed?\"",
		"  An equally terse response.",
		"  She was typically to the point, but Tobimaru got the impression that she was expressly trying to keep her interaction with Soujuurou short.",
		"\"...\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  They stared at each other in silence.",
		"  Tobimaru stood breathlessly silent on the sidelines until Soujuurou broke the impasse.",
		"\"I thought you of all people would understand, Aozaki.",
		"I mean, of course you do.",
		"  That's what makes you strong.\"",
		"  Soujuurou stood up from his seat.",
		"  He walked past Aoko and into the hallway.",
		"\"Do you mind if I start tomorrow?\"",
		"\"Whatever works for you, Shizuki.\"",
		"  He did his best to force a smile before leaving the student council room.",
		"   While watching the events play out, Tobimaru found himself deeply impressed with Soujuurou.",
		"  He could tell from Aoko's behavior that she was trying to get a rise out of Soujuurou. Soujuurou, on the other hand, was none the wiser to what Aoko was doing so he simply went about his way.",
		"  To Tobimaru, it was hard to believe that Soujuurou had not taken offense.",
		"  All he observed was the performance of a lifetime in Soujuurou as he maintained a poker face.",
		"\"The kid has some balls, huh, president?\"",
		"  He looked at Aoko curiously.",
		"  Aoko stood completely still, staring at the wall.",
		"\"...Hey, Aozaki?\"",
		"  Aoko showed no response.",
		"\"Yo. President. Earth to Aozaki, come in, come in. ...Lady Aoko?",
		"  ...",
		" Ahem. I'M TALKING TO YOU, AOKO AOZAKI!\"",
		"\"Enough with the 'AO, AO, AO,' already! God!\"",
		"  Her fury echoed across the student council room.",
		"  It was a beautiful sound that could be heard into the hallway and made Tobimaru's rant from earlier pale in comparison.",
		"\"Look who's talking, miss megaphone!\"",
		"  Perhaps her shouting was still ringing in his ears, or he was just the type to answer a shout with a shout, but he shot back reflexively.",
		"\"No wonder you can't get a boyfriend.",
		"  Do I have your attention now?\"",
		"\"I could hear you before. I was just ignoring you because you were annoying me, and I thought it'd be easier than getting you to shut up.\"",
		"\"You've got some nerve. Am I a mosquito to you?\"",
		"\"A mosquito would offer better company, so no.\"",
		"\"...And what exactly is that supposed to mean?\"",
		"\"We never see eye to eye. Talking to you is like going on a date, both pointless activities.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Based on that statement, Aoko must have been under the assumption that dating is the act of two lovers whispering nonsense to each other.",
		"\"...The real question is what the hell qualifies as company to you, but whatever.",
		"  You could, you know, ease off a little from time to time.\"",
		"\"Always trying to smooth things over with that silver tongue of yours.\"",
		"\"At least I'm trying. It's like you stopped bothering to be civil two years ago.\"",
		"\"I'm always civil-just not when you're in the same room.\"",
		"\"So that's how it is. You're still upset with me for what happened, aren't you?\"",
		"  There was only one thing that Tobimaru could be talking about.",
		"  The incident that occurred in the student council room this past summer.",
		"\"Huh? Isn't that ancient history at this point?",
		"  Don't you think you should stop wasting brainpower on this? I mean, you've got so few brain cells to work with as it is.\"",
		"  As the conversation wore on, Aoko's murderous aura began to fade, and her sharp gaze gave way to a calmer demeanor rarely seen from her.",
		"  It was quite possible that nobody besides Tobimaru had ever seen this side of her at school before.",
		"\"Thanks for the concern, psych. And for the record, it's not like I want to relive it either.",
		"  ...It's just, when Sono-G was being an idiot earlier, it kinda reminded me of how it went down. Come to think of it, this is the room it happened in!\"",
		"  Despite his ranting, his face betrayed a touch of nostalgia.",
		"  Aoko, on the other hand, was scowling.",
		"\"Hold on.",
		"  You didn't tell him about what happened, did you?\"",
		"\"Sure did. At least,",
		"how you mocked my candidacy for president and told me my face had sidekick written all over it.",
		"  And the part where I took the bait and tried my damnedest to punch you for it.\"",
		"  Aoko let out a sigh... as if relieved that Tobimaru had not told Soujuurou the rest of the story.",
		"  Even she wasn't sure why.",
		"\"I'll admit that was quite a punch though.",
		"  It was enough to make me react on reflex.",
		"  Did I really say that, by the way?\"",
		"\"You sure did. And not only that-after I was taken to the infirmary, you had the balls to tell me you did me a favor by forcing me to be your number two.\"",
		"  Since that day, Tobimaru had served as the vice-president to the person who'd usurped the role from him.",
		"\"It's fine, though. The president's chair doesn't suit me anyway. I feel much more at home as the vice-president. Your job would have probably turned me into my dad.\"",
		"\"Your pride's never allowed you to give anything less than your best.",
		"  You might be a little too comfortable on the student council, though. Makes me wonder how you would've looked as an honor student.\"",
		"\"Don't even go there. Even thinking about it gives me the creeps.",
		"  Having one wolf in sheep's clothing around here is bad enough.\"",
		"  Tobimaru shooed Aoko away like an annoying pest.",
		"  It was a typical example of the crude verbal abuse they exchanged on a daily basis, with a wittiness that only two longtime foes could manage.",
		"\"So...",
		" Why did you tell him?\"",
		"\"Tell who what?\"",
		"\"Why did you tell him what happened between you and me?\"",
		"\"Oh, that.",
		"  I was just trying to put a stop to the nonsense he was spewing and―\"",
		"  He stopped himself before he said any more.",
		"  He knew better than to let slip the fact that Soujuurou had a thing for Aoko. Everyone knew guys didn't sell each other out like that.",
		"  Even if it was all, in truth, a misunderstanding.",
		"\"Anyway, what the hell was that before, Aozaki?",
		"  That's some grudge you've got against Soujuurou.\"",
		"\"I'm not some princess who goes around holding grudges for something that happened over a week ago, you know.\"",
		"  He wanted to retort that she was more like a queen than a princess.",
		"  But he'd come to know her too well over the past two years to dig himself into a hole like that.",
		"\"Okay, so why'd you a pick a fight with him?",
		" I mean, he does throw you off when you talk to him, but there's not an evil bone in his body.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"\"Wow. Why are you looking at me like you just stepped in a turd?\"",
		"\"Oh, no big reason. Hearing you say that, I was just thinking that I've never met such a despicable person in my life.\"",
		"\"...Well, whatever. So he's a good guy? That makes him the perfect person to pick a fight with. If nobody else'll do it, the job falls to me, right?\"",
		"  She said casually, having regained her composure.",
		"\"You just can't help yourself, huh.\"",
		"  Tobimaru could not follow her reasoning at all.",
		"  Tobimaru was used to Aoko's erratic trains of thought, but hating Soujuurou for no reason seemed needlessly cruel. His friend's naive and innocent face came to mind, and then he blurted,",
		"\"But Soujuurou's taken a shine to you, Aozaki. How can you hate him, knowing that?\"",
		"  His vow of silence had lasted not even two minutes.",
		"\"Oh. Um... What I meant was...\"",
		"  He tried to take it back, but it was too late.",
		"  She had heard his words loud and clear.",
		"All he could hope for now was that she would take it well.",
		"\"Because I like what I like and dislike what I don't like.",
		"  Just because he wants to be friends doesn't mean I have to suddenly like him.\"",
		"  Stone. Cold. Aoko.",
		"  Tobimaru found himself filled with indignation at how detached Aoko was being.",
		"\"Don't you get it? This isn't just about friendship!",
		"  And I didn't mean he only 'likes' you, either! Believe me when I say that Sono-G really has a thing for you!\"",
		"  He shouted, his face the embodiment of sincerity.",
		"  Aoko gave him a blank stare.",
		"  It was the face of someone who had lost their wallet hours earlier and was only just realizing it now.",
		"  The first instant of doubt that ushers in the reality of the situation.",
		"  But, an instant is all it was.",
		"\"So what?\"",
		"  She answered coolly,",
		"  as if she had no idea why it should matter to her at all.",
		"\"'So what'?! Were you born in hell?! I'll assume you didn't hear me and I'll say it again. Soujuurou-\"",
		"  Tobimaru gave up any pretense of masculine solidarity and fired back hard.",
		"\"Don't bother. I couldn't care less.\"",
		"  She ruthlessly cut him off.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Thinking of the boys who still harbored unrequited love for Aoko, Tobimaru tried hard to come up with a name befitting the demoness in front of him.",
		"\"Now I see. So that's why you told him about our little incident.",
		"  Who could have thought His Highness could be so considerate to his friends?",
		"  I bet you also told him all the nasty rumors floating about me, too, huh.\"",
		"  She laughed as a fiendish smile adorned her face.",
		"  Tobimaru repented to God, whoever and wherever he or she might be, for ever bringing up Aoko's love life.",
		"\"You did the right thing, Tobimaru. Now be a good little vice-president and tell me every single thing you told him.\"",
		"  She was smiling, but Tobimaru wished she'd at least try to hide the bloodlust.",
		"\"Just two things, really... The story you're most infamous for, and what happened in this room.\"",
		"  Aoko nodded with satisfaction as she listened to Tobimaru's hesitant answer.",
		"\"Rumors like those can come in handy sometimes. You can use them to chase off annoying people. Just be careful about who you tell, okay?\"",
		"  Had this been in writing, the chillingly sweet tone of her words could've been signed with a heart.",
		"  Whether angry or happy, Aozaki spoke in a disturbingly cute manner when she was in a heightened emotional state.",
		"  Tobimaru took note of this new discovery, aware that it did nothing to get him out of this situation.",
		"\"Don't worry. I value my life, so I'll shut my mouth.",
		"  ...But Aozaki... Do you really hate Soujuurou that much?\"",
		"  He knew that it was a topic he would be better off avoiding, but he tried asking anyway.",
		"  The bonds between men, at times, shine more beautifully than a pearl.",
		"\"Well... I might not like him... but that doesn't mean I hate him. I'm not even sure why I feel the way I do.",
		"  Which is probably the problem.\"",
		"  Perhaps to placate Tobimaru, Aoko paused in contemplation before she answered.",
		"  Giving it a moment without immediately blurting out a response meant that not even he could complain.",
		"\"Huh. I guess that makes sense.",
		"  As much as emotional arguments can make sense. There's nothing I can do if neither of you understand why you feel the way you do.\"",
		"  Thinking that would be the end of it, Tobimaru looked up toward the ceiling and silently apologized to Soujuurou.",
		"  However...",
		"  His final sentence appeared to have piqued Aoko's interest.",
		"\"...Wait. What do you mean by that?\"",
		"  Her faux cheer had vanished.",
		"  Failing to pick up on this, Tobimaru answered nonchalantly.",
		"\"Oh, nothing. It's just that Soujuurou also said he wasn't exactly sure why he liked you... or more like, there was no particular reason for how he felt, I think.\"",
		"  Tobimaru was still in disbelief that Soujuurou had been charmed by Aoko's appearance, so he purposely left that part out.",
		"\"He said he likes me... for no reason?\"",
		"\"Yeah. I mean, I even told him about all the rumors around you, and it had no effect on him whatsoever. What did he say again...? Oh, right. He was going on about how genuine your concern for him was, and how it really helped him. It's almost too mushy for me to repeat out loud.",
		"  All I can say is that, unlike the other boys, the rumors didn't faze him in the least.\"",
		"  Tobimaru finally noticed the shift in Aoko's demeanor.",
		"  She was scowling at the wall.",
		"  She glared at it in silence like it was her worst enemy, and this continued for several minutes.",
		"\"...What the hell is that? Why can't I shake the feeling that I've heard all this before somewhere.\"",
		"  So great was her ire that the gnashing of her teeth was audible.",
		"  The irritation seethed until it reached the point that Aoko forgot Tobimaru was even in the room.",
		"  Tobimaru looked heavenward for forgiveness, sensing that he'd brought further calamity down upon Soujuurou's head.",
		"\"...I kind of get it now. I think I know why I don't like him.\"",
		"  Tobimaru looked away as if to indicate that he'd rather not know, but Aoko ignored him and began to grumble venomously.",
		"\"The way he acts and talks reminds me of someone I despise.",
		"  Like how everyone thinks he's an angel, and how nothing seems to bother him. Maybe it's how good he is at getting on my nerves.\"",
		"  Glancing idly up at the clock, Tobimaru thought that last part just sounded like misplaced anger.",
		"  And that was that.",
		"  One o'clock had come and gone.",
		"\"...Fine. I get it. Sorry I said anything.",
		"  So did you need me for anything? Class has already started, you know.\"",
		"\"Huh? What do you mean by class? ",
		"When did it...\"",
		"\"The bell rang right after Sono-G left, around the time you were busy being pissed off at the wall. Tell me, Ms. President. Are you allowed to miss fifth period?\"",
		"\"Of course I'm not!",
		"  Why didn't you say something?!\"",
		"  She looked like she was on the verge of tears as she shouted and pulled at his necktie.",
		"Tobimaru raised his hands in mock surrender-a gesture  reserved only for the true victor.",
		"\"Consider this revenge for saying I was worse than a mosquito.",
		"  Hopefully you've learned your lesson, oh hellish demon who feasts upon the hearts of men.\"",
		"\"You're so petty, you know that?!",
		"  You're supposed to repay insults with insults, you coward!\"",
		"  She tightened his necktie around his neck with a yank.",
		"  The vice-president smiled a thuggish grin, as if her reaction made his victory that much sweeter.",
		"\"Heh. It's no secret you're heading to remedial classics. And I don't have to tell you who teaches Class A during fifth period. Old bat Fujishiro is going to have your head!\"",
		"  Fujishiro had one of the longest tenures at the school, so it was only natural she would be in charge of teaching the classics.",
		"\"This is where you stop yanking on my tie and haul ass to your classroom.",
		"  I won't even try to stop you. Am I not merciful?\"",
		"\"Damn! It! All! I can't believe you of all people pulled one over on me!",
		"  Just die already!\"",
		"  She choked him even harder with his necktie.",
		"  As Aoko put words into action and mercilessly strangled Tobimaru, he saw his life flash before his eyes.",
		"\"Ggahhhh! Wait! Stop! I'm gonna die! It isn't too late! Do you want them to mark you absent?!\"",
		"  Aoko glanced up at the clock.",
		"  It was still only seven past one. Her route was from the student council room on the second floor to the Class A classroom on the third floor. If she ran she could make it.",
		"\"I'll let you live, Tobimaru. This time.\"",
		"  Aoko clicked her tongue disappointedly.",
		"  What disturbed Tobimaru was that it didn't sound like an empty threat. ",
		"\"Be here after school.",
		"  I actually do have something I need you to do.\"",
		"  She was halfway out of the room before she even finished her sentence.",
		"  Finally all alone,",
		"Tobimaru closed the open door, locked it,",
		"and slumped into a chair.",
		"\"...Never a dull moment with Aozaki around, that's for sure.\"",
		"  He leaned back in the creaky folding chair and let out a sigh.",
		"  The weather outside was beautiful.",
		"  But the sunlight waned early in the winter.",
		"  Before long, daylight would fade, and the unheated student council room would grow colder and colder.",
		"  All of the good equipment, like the heater, had ended up in the main office, so he had no choice but to settle in for a chilly afternoon.",
		"\"If only this weather would last...",
		"  Shame the forecast predicted more clouds.\"",
		"  After his somewhat suggestive monologue, Tobimaru's mind drifted.",
		"  He idly wondered to himself whether Soujuurou was an overcast day or a clear day sort of guy, but no answers came."
