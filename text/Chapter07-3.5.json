		"　夜中、洋館を歩いていると不思議なコトに遭遇する。",
		"　館内にただよう霧や、",
		"　増えたり減ったりするドア。",
		"　絨毯の手入れをする子豚っぽい影を見たかと思えば、このように、",
		"　サンルームに向かってはかき消える、鳥たちの羽音を聞いたりもする。",
		"「なにごと……！？」",
		"　たいていの事は見ざる聞かざるな草十郎も、今の羽音は聞き過ごせなかった。",
		"　一羽や二羽の話ではないのだ。",
		"　十羽単位の鳥がサンルームに突撃したとすれば、窓ガラスとて無事では済むまい。",
		"　いてもたってもいられず、草十郎はちり取りと<箒|ほうき>を手にして走りだした。",
		"　生来の小姑根性か、せいいっぱいの自己防衛か。",
		"　今日の授業でたまたま、",
		"「皆さんも部屋の整頓は心がけてくださいね。人間の自制心って環境に流されるらしいですから。",
		"ほら、それまで犯罪の少ない街だったのに、一つボロボロの家が出来ただけで近隣住人がみーんな自堕落になるというアレ。",
		"　環境への無関心さがすさんだ精神を作り上げるとか眉唾ですけど、正直なところ、ブームだからって盗んだバイクで走り回ったり、学校の廊下の窓ガラスとか割ってまわっちゃダメですよ。先生の仕事が増えますから」",
		"　時に、校内暴力がある種の若者にとってステータスになっていた時代の話である。",
		"「窓が割れると、心が荒れる」",
		"　草十郎はなるほど、と今日聞いた話を<反芻|はんすう>する。",
		"　割れ窓理論を聞いていた彼にとって、洋館内のモラル低下は放っておけない。",
		"　……同居人は<既|すで>にして十分なほど凶暴だが、これ以上<横暴|おうぼう>さが増しては、なにより本人の為にならない。また学校でよからぬ噂が流れてしまう。",
		"　我らが生徒会長の名誉を守る為。",
		"　ひいては実害から自分の身を守る為、草十郎はサンルームの掃除に向かったのだが―――",
		"「む？」",
		"　この通り、サンルームには鳥の姿はおろか、鳴き声さえ有りはしなかった。",
		"「あら」",
		"「――――――」",
		"　中庭を<臨|のぞ>むテーブルには、午後のお茶を<愉|たの>しむ蒼崎青子と久遠寺有珠の姿のみ。",
		"　草十郎ソナー探知で十八羽は居たであろう鳥の気配はどこにもない。",
		"「いまここに鳥がこなかった！？」",
		"「有珠、見た？」",
		"「さあ。もう見えないのなら、いないという事でしょう」",
		"「だって。いないよ、鳥」",
		"　草十郎ですら感じ取れる、<清々|すがすが>しいまでの嘘である。",
		"「そんなバカな」",
		"　さっきの羽音は聞き間違いではない。",
		"　こと野生動物の生態については<一家言|いっかげん>あるのか、草十郎は急ぎ足で窓まで移動し、ますます眉を<曇|くも>らせた。",
		"　窓ガラスには鳥の跡はおろか、羽の一枚すら落ちていない。",
		"「あ。夕食、<鶏|とり>鍋？」",
		"　鳥を探す草十郎を見て、なぜその発想にいきつくのか。",
		"「あいにく、今日のバイトは魚屋さんだ。<鰯|いわし>でよければ土産にするけど」",
		"「鰯……鰯か……私、あのパイ嫌いなのよね……。",
		"　いえ、むしろ鰯のパイとか食べたコトないのよね……」",
		"　青子の<独|ひと>り芸は、この時代ではあまりに高度すぎたようだ。",
		"　草十郎は窓ガラスから離れ、とぼとぼサンルームを後にし、",
		"　今まで幾度とあった、有珠からのよく分からない視線を感じた。",
		"「なんだい、<有|アリ>―――」",
		"　何か聞きたい事でもあるのだろうか、と声をかけ、",
		"「あいたっ」",
		"　そんな草十郎の頭部に、青い流星が直撃した。",
		"　流星の正体は言うまでもない。",
		"　洋館に出没する謎の駒鳥である。",
		"　チチチチチチ、と甲高く駒鳥は<訴|うった>える。",
		"　……実のところ。",
		"　草十郎に激突するコレこそが洋館の七不思議、その最たるものだった。",
		"　アルバイトに向かう途中、多くの人々とすれ違う。",
		"　まだ都会慣れしていない草十郎にとって、駅前通りの人の流れは圧巻だ。",
		"　誰一人として、同じ服装や歩き方の人間がいない。",
		"　ここまで人が多ければ似たような外見の人間がいそうなものだが、ただの一人も<被|かぶ>っていない。",
		"　多種多様な街の<賑|にぎ>わいに、子供のように感心してしまう。",
		"「―――いや」",
		"　草十郎は目を閉じて反省した。",
		"　こんな事で感心しているようじゃまだまだ田舎者だ、とため息をつく。",
		"「ちょっと。青信号で突っ立ってられるの、邪魔なんだけど。なにガラにもなく<黄昏|たそが>れてるんだか」",
		"　と。ややセンチになっていた背中に、聞き覚えのある、刺々しい声がかけられた。",
		"「なんだ、まっどべあに行く途中だったんだ。",
		"　……ふーん。わたしはコンビニのバイト。こっちは五時からだけど、静希は？」",
		"「同じく五時から。<久|く><万|ま><梨|り>はどこか寄るところでも？」",
		"「本屋に寄った帰り。読みたかった本がなくなってたから、仕方なく出歩いてたところよ」",
		"「なるほど。時間を持て余しているところも同じだね」",
		"　声をかけてきたのはバイト先の知り合いでもあり、同期生でもある<久万梨|くまり><金鹿|こじか>だった。",
		"　声をかけてきた、というよりは因縁をつけてきた、という表現の方が正しいのだが。",
		"　久万梨は草十郎にとってはじめての先輩でもある。",
		"　最初のアルバイト先で知り合い、",
		"　レジ打ちを間違え続けた事からコンビニは向いてないから辞めろと本気で軽蔑され、なぜか最後に、",
		"“こっちの方が貴方に向いてる”と<中華飯店|まっどべあ>を紹介してくれた人物だ。",
		"「なにその無理矢理な顔。なんか元気ない。いつも以上にイラっとくるわ。",
		"　静希のいいところなんて、いつもピシッとしている背筋ぐらいなのに、みっともなく丸まってるし。",
		"　もしかして悩みとかあるの？　……まっどべあに質の悪い先輩でもいるとか。それなら話ぐらいは聞いてあげるから、言ってみたら？」",
		"　態度こそ厳しいものの、久万梨の目は真剣である。",
		"　都会育ちの久万梨にとって、静希草十郎という人間はそのすべてが癪に障るらしい。",
		"　が、それはそれとして、彼女は草十郎を対等の知人として捉えている。",
		"　バイト先を紹介してくれたのも、そういう彼女の生真面目さ故だった。",
		"「いや、別に悩みとかそういうんじゃなくて。不思議なコトがあったというか、珍しいものを見たというか……」",
		"　どう説明するべきか考えながら、草十郎は用件だけを口にした。",
		"　まっどべあには何の問題もない。",
		"　商店街の<魚達|ウオタツ>と同じぐらい好い職場だ。",
		"　そういった仕事の話とはまったく関係なく、",
		"　最近、青い鳥によくつっつかれるのだと。",
		"「鳥につっつかれる？　なにそれ、小さい悩み。",
		"　……でもまあ、青い鳥っていうのは確かに珍しいわね」",
		"「いや、珍しいのは外見の話じゃなくて……」",
		"　うまく説明できず言いよどむ。",
		"　あの青い鳥の、でっぷりとした外見や鳴き声を、人語でどう表現したものだろうか？",
		"「……ふーん。綺麗な青色といったらマウンテンブルーバードだけど、日本にはいないわよね。",
		"　青いツバメだったらいるかもしれないけど」",
		"「いや、ツバメじゃなくて、丸っこいんだ。図鑑で調べたんだけど、どうもコマドリっぽい。けど」",
		"「うん、青色のコマドリは存在しない。",
		"　……静希は縁日の青ひよこって知ってる？　知らないわよね。いい、そう面白い話じゃないから忘れて。",
		"　それより、そのコマドリって一羽だけなの？」",
		"「ああ、一羽だけだ。つがいは見あたらない」",
		"「ふーん。突然変異だとしたらちょっと可哀想ね。",
		"　……生まれた時から最後の一羽だなんて、孤独にもほどがあるわ。",
		"　どんな鳥かは知らないけど、次に見かけたら優しくしてあげたら？　自販機で十円を拾う、ぐらいの幸運は運んでくれるかもよ」",
		"　久万梨の言い分は優しさあふれるものだが、あの駒鳥につっつかれる草十郎としては、何とも頷きがたいものだった。",
		"　そもそも孤独なんて、あの駒鳥にもっとも似合わない表現ではないだろうか？",
		"「いいじゃない、小鳥一羽ぐらい。",
		"　そりゃ都会で鳥につつかれるのは珍しいけど、いい方の珍事よ、それ。これがゴミ袋をあさるカラスの大軍だったら困りものでしょうけど」",
		"「あ。そういえば、他にも気になる事が」",
		"　久万梨の言葉から、草十郎は久遠寺邸・とり集団失踪事件を思い出した。",
		"　あの鳥たちも不思議と言えば不思議すぎる。",
		"「実は今、あそこに見える丘に住んでるんだけど。",
		"　でるんだ、大量のムクドリが頻繁に。そのクセ、街に出ると見かけない」",
		"「当たり前でしょ。町じゃ鳥なんて見かけないし、あそこは山だから動物は多いんじゃない？",
		"　それより貴方、あの山に引っ越したの？　前のアパートは引き払ったって聞いてたけど。……学校まで通うの、大変じゃない。なんだってあんな<辺鄙|へんぴ>なところに」",
		"「ちょっとした成り行きだよ。それに通うのは大変じゃない。大変なのは中の話なんだ」",
		"「？」",
		"　街に出るまで徒歩三十分。",
		"　近場のコンビニエンスストアまで四十分はかかる立地条件だが、草十郎にとって交通の不便さはそう問題ではない。",
		"　問題は住んでいる建物の人外魔境っぷりである。",
		"「すまない、それは久万梨に話すことじゃなかった。",
		"　それより今の話だ。町には鳥が少ないと言ったけど、どうして？」",
		"「……たんに、環境に適応できなかったのよ。",
		"　なに、鳥の話には随分と食いつくわね。静希、動物好き？」",
		"「どちらかというと好きな方だけど」",
		"「そ。わたしは嫌い。そんなわたしに鳥の話とかしてほしい？」",
		"　久万梨の言葉は矛盾に満ちている。",
		"　動物嫌いという彼女が、なぜ先ほど“鳥には優しく”と口にしたのか。",
		"「そうだな。嫌いなだけで苦手でないのなら、知ってる範囲で聞かせてほしい」",
		"「痛いトコつくじゃない。",
		"　いいわ、バイトまでの時間つぶしにしてあげる。",
		"　さっきの続き。環境に適応できるかできないかってところからね」",
		"「今でこそこんなだけど、三咲はここまで大きな町じゃなかったんだって。",
		"　昔はその半分が森だったから、彼らはもともと森に適した生活をしていたのよ」",
		"　久万梨は鳥たちを「彼ら」と呼んだ。",
		"　好きか嫌いかはともかく、鳥たちに敬意を払っている証だろう。",
		"「でも近代化した街じゃ自然のサイクルも成り立たない。人間ってのは、まず環境を自分たちの都合に変えるから。",
		"　<藪蚊|やぶか>が多いって事で小さな川の流れを変えたり、町中コンクリートで塗り固めちゃえば鳥的にはお手上げよ。",
		"　虫も森も少ないんじゃもう山に逃げるしかない。彼らは故郷を追われて、この森から山に移った。",
		"　人間にとって都合のいい町は、鳥たちが生きるコロニーにはなり得ないから」",
		"「……そんな事ぐらいで減るものか？",
		"　その、姿を見なくなるぐらいに？」",
		"「そこまで極端じゃない……とは思う。現に貴方だってムクドリを見てるでしょう？",
		"　比較の問題よ。町には人間が多いから、鳥の姿はよけい稀少に感じるだけ。たまに見かけるだけで、珍しいと思えるぐらいにね」",
		"「ああ、たしかに。じゃあ鳥は町から居なくなっただけで、あの山に移り住んで―――」",
		"　目立たないだけで、きちんと今も生き続けている。",
		"　時代と共に、その在り方、カタチは変わっても、まったくの無に帰する事はない。",
		"　そう安心して気を取り直す草十郎を、久万梨は冷めた顔で否定した。",
		"「あの山に天敵がいなければね。",
		"　人間の手による<乱獲|らんかく>か、移った先にいる生態系との衝突か。どちらにせよ、居場所を失った彼らの寿命は短いと思う。一世紀持てばいい方かもしれない。",
		"　……リョコウバトの例もあるし。気が付いた時には取り返しつかないのが動物と人間の関係よ」",
		"「リョコウバト……？」",
		"「そ、リョコウバト。体長は四十センチほどもある、大型のきれいな鳥。",
		"　オスの翼は深い青色で、胸は鮮やかな<臙脂|えんじ>色。オレンジ色の目は嘘みたいに愛らしくて、その羽は時速百キロで長い距離を旅するの」",
		"　久万梨の声は、少しだけ優しい。",
		"　彼女は図鑑でしか観ることのない鳥の姿を、ひとり夢想しているようだった。",
		"「北アメリカにいた<鳩|ハト>でね、春は南から北へ、冬は冬越えのために北から南に移動するの。",
		"　今から百年以上も前の話よ。",
		"　彼らはかつて地上でもっとも繁殖した高等動物だった。",
		"　なにしろその数は五十億。当時の総人口より多かったっていうんだから、圧巻よね」",
		"「なんと。人間より数の多い動物がいたっていうのか？」",
		"「うん。でも彼らは絶滅したわ。他ならぬ人間の手によって。",
		"　１６世紀にヨーロッパからアメリカ大陸にやってきた探検家たちは、空を覆いつくすほどの鳥の群を見た。",
		"　それがリョコウバトを<記|しる>した、一番古くて確かな記録」",
		"「……まあ、わたしも本で知った知識だけど。",
		"　太陽を隠して、そのおびただしい数で森を覆って、雪のように糞を落としていく光景なんて、今じゃもう夢物語でしょうね。",
		"　でも当時の人にとっては悪夢だった。",
		"　リョコウバト一羽一羽は美しいフォルムをしていても、それだけの数が集まれば、それはもう暴力なんだから」",
		"「彼らはその時点では、森を破壊し、人間を脅かす悪魔のような存在だった。",
		"　営巣地は十キロメートルにまでおよんで、一コロニーにつき五万羽近い鳥の鳴き声が響いたのよ。",
		"　一瞬にして風景を変えるほどの鳥の群れと、世界を覆うほどの鳴き声。冒険家たちが<竦|すく>んだのもうなずけるわね」",
		"「一つの住み処に五万羽―――」",
		"　草十郎は指折り数えながら絶句した。",
		"　駅前の人の流れだけで手一杯な彼では、想像が追いつかないらしい。",
		"「でも、そんな数の鳥を、人間の手でどうやって？」",
		"「ええ。当時、誰もがそう思ったんでしょうね。",
		"　でも話は簡単だったの。人間にとってリョコウバトは脅威でもあったけど、同時に安価な<実|みの>りでもあったから」",
		"「渡り鳥の胸肉は美味しいでしょ。よく鍛えられてるから。",
		"　そんな食材が、空に向かって鉄砲を撃つだけでバタバタと落ちてきたとしたら、貴方はどうする？",
		"　ま―――身もフタもないコトを言えば、リョコウバトって鳥は、簡単にお金にできる生き物だった」",
		"「かくして、狩りは延々と続けられた。",
		"　落ちた鳥は羽をむしられて、塩漬けのタルにおしこまれて、次々と出荷された」",
		"「それはもう狩りですらなかった。ただの消費。人間側は労働の実感も、作業の手間すら感じなくなっていた。",
		"　その頃、リョコウバトは一羽一セントで手に入れる事が出来たんだって。ここでいうならたった一円。",
		"　―――ほんと、信じられる？",
		"　その国最小の通貨一枚で売買される命が、この地球にはあったなんて」",
		"　久万梨はあくまで他人事のように語る。",
		"　……なのに、声にかすかな翳りがあるのは、鳥たちへの謝罪か、同種への嫌悪からか。",
		"　どちらにせよ人間らしい、身勝手な<諧謔|かいぎゃく>だ。",
		"　一方。そんな人間らしさを、草十郎はまだ理解できないでいる。",
		"「けど、それはまだまだ序の口で、本番は１９世紀に入ってからだった。",
		"　人間のリョコウバト狩りはますます熱狂していった。",
		"　学校で習ったでしょ。ゴールドラッシュ、南北戦争を経て、アメリカ合衆国は急激に成長していく。",
		"　西欧からの移民は増え続け、１８７０年には４０００万もの人口に達していたわ。そんな移民たちの胃袋と財布を満たす材料として、リョコウバトは最高の獲物だった」",
		"「で、もっと最悪な事に、人間は工夫する生き物だった。",
		"　彼らはより速く、より多く、より簡単にリョコウバトを乱獲する手段を競い合った。",
		"　目を潰したハトを囮にして集団を誘いこんで、一日で一万羽以上捕らえたヤツさえいた。それでも彼らは乱獲に疑問すら持たなかった。",
		"　―――繁殖と狩猟のバランスは、誰が見ても明らかに狂っていたのに」",
		"　淡々と、努めて冷静でいるように淡々と、久万梨は語る。",
		"　一方、草十郎はただ感心するばかりだった。",
		"　山育ちである草十郎からすれば気持ちのいい話ではないのに、今は、「どうしてそうなったのか」という疑問の方が強いらしい。",
		"「それ、一方的すぎないか？　リョコウバトだって数が減ってくれば、人間には近寄らないんじゃ」",
		"「そこが彼らの不幸だったのよ。",
		"　リョコウバトは繁殖力が非常に弱くて、自衛手段を持たない鳥だった。大群で暮らすこと。それだけが、彼らの身を守る手段だったの」",
		"「彼らが五十億の王国を築けたのは、それまで天敵がいなかったからなんでしょうね。先住民であるインディアンも彼らを乱獲する事はなかったと言うし。",
		"　けど入植者たちは自然のサイクルにはてんで<疎|うと>かった。",
		"　何より、あの<夥|おびただ>しい数の鳥が絶滅するなんて夢にも思わなかった。",
		"　リョコウバトにしたら青天の霹靂よ。まさか何世紀も遅れて、海の向こうから天敵がやってくるなんて」",
		"「そうして１８９６年。人間はようやく、熱狂を覚ますほどの現実に直面したわ。",
		"　たったの２５万羽。",
		"　それが確認されたリョコウバトの総数。何もかも手遅れよ。急いで保護法が作られたけど、人間の習慣はそう簡単には変わらないわ」",
		"「あるいは、狩人たちはこう思ったのかもしれない。",
		"　<ま|・><だ|・><２|・><５|・><万|・><羽|・><も|・><い|・><る|・><じ|・><ゃ|・><な|・><い|・><か|・>、千羽や二千羽ぐらいなら独り占めしても構わないだろう、って」",
		"「そうしてハンターたちは当時最新の技術―――電報でリョコウバトたちの所在を報せあって、実に２０万羽のリョコウバトを仕留め、４万羽を傷つけた。",
		"　生き延びたのは５０００羽だけ。この時点で、彼らは野生で生きられる種ではなくなったのよ」",
		"　草十郎は顔をしかめている。",
		"“野生で生きられる種ではない。”",
		"　その言葉の意味を、彼は言われるまでもなく知っているからだ。",
		"　野生動物は単体で生き続けるものではない。",
		"　全体の数と、それを支える餌場を一定数維持できなければ、存続する事ができない。",
		"　<大|・><群|・><で|・><あ|・><る|・><事|・>がリョコウバトのシステムであったのなら、もうその時点で、彼らは袋小路に入っていた。",
		"「それで、リョコウバトはどうなったんだ？」",
		"「最後に保護されたリョコウバトはたったの三羽。",
		"　シンシナティの動物園ではオス二羽、メス一羽のリョコウバトが飼育されたけど、一年でオスたちは死んじゃったわ。",
		"　残されたのはメス一羽だけ。",
		"　その時点で、彼女は地上でもっとも孤独な生き物になった」",
		"「名前はマーサ。",
		"　北アメリカを旅する鳥たちの最後の一羽でありながら、ただの一度も空を飛ぶ事ができなかった<籠|かご>の鳥。",
		"　結局、２９年で彼女はその命を終えたわ。",
		"　１９１４年９月１日午後１時。",
		"　一つの種が終わる時間がここまで正確に残っている例は、今のところこれだけよ」",
		"　……五十億の死にまつわる話は終わった。",
		"　文明に飲みこまれた鳥の末路。",
		"　失われた鳥たちへの哀歌のような久万梨の話は、しかし、草十郎にはあまり伝わらなかったようだ。",
		"「意外。できるだけ詩的に語ったつもりだけど、ウケ、悪いみたい。",
		"山育ちの貴方には<憤慨|ふんがい>ものの話だと思ったのに」",
		"「え―――いや、すごい話だったけど。",
		"　その、整理がつかなくて。当時の人たちは自分たちの手で減らしておいたのに、なんで最後は保護したのかって」",
		"　その呟きを聞いて、久万梨はきょとんと眉を上げた。",
		"　おそらく、草十郎はこう言いたかったのだ。",
		"“奪うために減らしたのに、なぜ最後の一羽を守ろうとしたのか”と。",
		"　久万梨が思い違いをしたのも無理はない。",
		"　都会育ちの彼女には、草十郎の疑問の危うさは理解できない。",
		"　この少年にはまだ、",
		"　人間の身勝手な行為への怒りも、",
		"　<住処|すみか>から移動しなかった鳥たちへの同情もない。",
		"　そのどちらかに肩入れする<独善|じぶん>を、ここまで育てずに暮らしてきた。",
		"「……あいかわらず、よく分かんないヤツ。",
		"　ま、わたしが言いたかったのは、どんなに強く美しく見えても、居場所から追われた生き物ははかないってコト。",
		"　静希くん。",
		"　貴方が見た鳥は、その最後の一羽かもしれないわよ？」",
		"　……<益体|やくたい>のない立ち話は終わった。",
		"　アルバイトの時間が近づき、草十郎は一足先にバイト先へ向かっていった。",
		"「……らしくない。なに熱く語ってたんだろ、わたし」",
		"　草十郎と別れた後も、久万梨は公園に留まっていた。",
		"　マーサ。最後の一羽。",
		"　そのフレーズは青い鳥にあてられたものではなく―――",
		"「やめやめ。珍しいから特別視するとか、バカみたいだし」",
		"　我が事のように愚痴りながら頭をかく。",
		"　久万梨からすれば草十郎は赤の他人で、同じクラスの仲間でもない。",
		"　リョコウバトの話に熱が入ったのは、嫌いなコトの話ほど熱心に調べてしまう彼女の悪癖の結果である。",
		"　カタチのいい眉をひそめる。",
		"　まっどべあで働く以上、ヘンな悩みを抱えて欲しくないので話し相手になったが、あるいは、あの少年に妙な磁力があるのだろうか？",
		"　話せば話すほど深みに<嵌|はま>っている気がする。",
		"「まあ、見てて頼りないってのが一番だろうけど……話してみるとしっかりしすぎてるのよね、彼」",
		"　久万梨はそうぼやきながら、別れ際の会話を思い出した。",
		"“で、少しは町に慣れた？”",
		"　そう訊いた久万梨に、草十郎は頼りなげに首を振った。",
		"“全然。何にせよ、覚えなくちゃいけない事が多すぎて”",
		"　日々新しい出会いがあって、それを飲みこむだけで手一杯。",
		"　あの純朴な少年は弱々しく見えるものの、町のすべてを受け入れようと全力で立っているのだ。",
		"　しかし―――日々新しい出会いがある、というのは大仰すぎるのではないか。",
		"　出会ったものを一つも取り落とさないよう努力するのは、彼が素直すぎるからだ。",
		"“どうだろう。素直って言うのはちょっと違うと思うよ。",
		"　単に、それが良いことか悪いことか、まだ分かってないだけかもしれないし”",
		"　彼はばつが悪そうに返す。",
		"“そうね。でも、もしかしたら、そもそも―――”",
		"　そこまで言いかけて、久万梨はまた今度、と手を振って別れる事にした。",
		"　思い返すとますますため息がでてきた。",
		"　コンビニエンスストアのアルバイトまであと五分ほど。",
		"　久万梨は頬を叩いて先ほどの会話を飲み下す。",
		"　他人のコトで気を病む余裕も、考察にふける義理もない。",
		"　彼女は彼女で、大学進学の費用を貯める野望がある。",
		"　<日夜|にちや>両親の反対と戦う久万梨金鹿にとって、同級生の悩みなど二の次だ。",
		"「……でも、もしかしたら、そもそも、か」",
		"　我ながらなんて思わせぶりで、実のない言い回しかと苦笑いする。",
		"「ほんと、はっきり言ってやればよかった。",
		"　貴方は単に、<人の善悪|そういうの>に関わる気が、これっぽっちもないんじゃないのかって」",
		"　だからアイツ嫌いなのよ、と。",
		"　悪態にもとれるため息をこぼして、彼女は公園を後にした。",
		"　草十郎がアルバイトを終え、土産の<鰯|いわし>を片手に居間に入ると、ソファーには有珠の姿があった。",
		"「や。こんばんは、有珠」",
		"「………………」",
		"　さすがの草十郎も、まだ「ただいま」と言えるだけの親しみはないらしい。",
		"　草十郎はそのまま台所に移動し、バケツに水を溜めて魚を保存しようとして、",
		"背後からイヤそうな視線を感じ、しずしずと冷蔵庫を開けた。",
		"『台所にバケツはダメなんだな……』",
		"　仕方ない、とお手軽に魚を冷蔵庫にしまって、草十郎は居間の様子を窺った。",
		"「有珠、蒼崎は？」",
		"「さあ。自分の部屋にいるか、出かけているんでしょう」",
		"　にべもなく返される。",
		"　そうかと頷いて、草十郎はやや散らかった台所を片づけはじめた。",
		"　特に話題もないし、無理に話をする必要性も感じなかったからだろう。",
		"　水回りを片づけ、まな板を洗い、包丁を拭き、食器を調理時に出しやすい位置に整理整頓する。",
		"　そんな、いずれ凄腕のハウスキーパーになる事を約束された、よどみのない作業っぷりを、",
		"　じっと観察する黒い目が、二つ。",
		"　草十郎がその視線に気が付くのは時間の問題だ。",
		"　身をかがめて、台所の収納に<寸胴|ずんどう>をしまう。",
		"　そのまま立ち上がれば、居間にいる有珠と視線がばったり合って、",
		"『メェーーーデーーーっすよーーーー！",
		"　小僧、今すぐロビーに顔を貸すっスーー！』",
		"「あいたっ」",
		"　その直前。",
		"立ち上がろうとした草十郎の後頭部に、青い衝撃が突き刺さった。",
		"　確かめるまでもない。",
		"　洋館内せましと飛び回る、青い駒鳥だった。",
		"「……洋館に戻ってくるなり、駒鳥に呼び出される」",
		"　ぼそっと呟く。",
		"　草十郎なりに、誰かにグチを言いたい気分だったのだろう。",
		"『小僧、ちょっとそこに座るッス』",
		"　チチチと駒鳥はさえずる。",
		"　……さて。",
		"　実のところ、<頻繁|ひんぱん>に激突してくるコレこそが洋館の七不思議、その最たるものだった。",
		"　なぜなら、",
		"『なめてるっすね？　ジブン駒鳥だってなめてるッスね？　ところで鳥鍋ってどういうコトっすか、それ美味しいんっスか、今度みまってほしいッス！』",
		"　この通り。",
		"　駒鳥が何を伝えたいのか、草十郎にはなんとなく分かってしまうのだ。",
		"　山育ちの草十郎にとって、これこそが悪夢だった。",
		"　しゃべる動物なんて聞いた事もない。",
		"　そりゃあ、ごく<希|まれ>に、十年以上も山で暮らしていれば鳥の気持ちが分かるような時はある。もちろん錯覚だが、ちょっとだけ友情を感じる時もあった。",
		"　だがこれはない。",
		"　都会人より動物に馴れている分、草十郎は野<生動|かれら>物に対しては徹底的なリアリストなのである。",
		"「しかし、現実だ」",
		"　頭を抱えて無視したいところだが、久万梨に聞いた話が脳裏をよぎる。",
		"　鳥には優しく。",
		"　それが珍しいものなら、珍しいものなりに孤独を抱えているのだとか、なんとか。",
		"『座れって言ってるのにシカトっすか。",
		"　あ、でもイスないッスねココ。じゃあ立ってるッス。小坊主だけに、廊下に立ってるのがお似合いッス。",
		"　あれ、いまウマイこと言ったっスかねジブン！？』",
		"　羽ばたいているのも疲れたのか、駒鳥は受話器の横に着陸する。",
		"　草十郎に打つ手はない。",
		"　基本、この鳥の鳴き声を聞くだけが対抗手段なのだった。",

		"  Walking around the mansion at night often led to mysterious encounters.",
		"  Mist might suddenly fill the hallway,",
		"  or doors might appear and disappear.",
		"  Just when Soujuurou thought he had seen it all with pig-shaped shadows mending the carpet,",
		"  he heard the sound of a bird's flapping coming from the sunroom.",
		"\"What's going on over there?!\"",
		"  As much as he had become accustomed to turning a blind eye to such occurrences, the sound of flapping wings in the sunroom was too much to ignore.",
		"  And not just one bird, or even two, it sounded like dozens.",
		"  So many birds packed in the sunroom would inevitably lead to shattered windows and broken glass.",
		"  Soujuurou grabbed a broom and dashed toward the sound, prepared for the worst.",
		"  Perhaps he was moved by his natural impulse to help, or desperate self-defense.",
		"  His mind flashed to what a teacher had said at school.",
		"\"You should all make sure to keep your rooms orderly and clean. Work ethic and self-discipline will have a positive impact on your surroundings.",
		"Think about it. Even in a nice neighborhood where there isn't much crime, it only takes one ill-kept house to send the whole block into a spiral of depravity.",
		"  Of course, we all know a messy room won't turn you into a criminal. But I'd better not catch any of you breaking windows in the hallway or going for a joy ride on stolen motorcycles. Think of all the pain you'd be causing your poor teacher!\"",
		"  At the time, school gangs had garnered a certain reputation among the youths.",
		"\"Broken windows lead to broken hearts.\"",
		"  Soujuurou appreciated the basic message of the lecture as he ruminated over it.",
		"  The thought of broken windows had given him a sense of urgency, as if the mansion's very moral foundations were at stake.",
		"  His roommates were harsh enough with him already; anything further would only lead to rampant rumors at school about their cruelty.",
		"  He had to protect the honor of the student council president.",
		"  It was also concern for his own safety that sent him rushing to the sunroom. However...",
		"\"Huh?\"",
		"  There wasn't a bird to be seen or a chirp to be heard upon his arrival.",
		"\"Oh, hey.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Only Alice and Aoko, sipping afternoon tea at the table that overlooked the courtyard, were present.",
		"  The dozens of birds Soujuurou had sensed with his mountain intuition were nowhere to be seen.",
		"\"Did anyone see a flock of birds?!\"",
		"\"Alice?\"",
		"\"Who knows. If can't see them, there must not be any birds.\"",
		"\"You heard her; no birds.\"",
		"  It was a lie so blatant even Soujuurou could see through it.",
		"\"That can't be true.\"",
		"  He knew for a fact he had heard the flapping of a flock of birds.",
		"  Unable to accept that there really were no wild animals in the room, Soujuurou approached the windows with suspicion.",
		"  There were no feathers or any other signs of birds having been outside, either.",
		"\"Oh right, dinner. Chicken stew, was it?\"",
		"  Of course Aoko would say something like that as she watched Soujuurou search desperately.",
		"\"Sorry, I'm working at the fish place tonight. But I've got you covered if you want sardines.\"",
		"\"Sardines... Sardines, huh... I don't like sardine pie...",
		"  Not that I've ever had it.\"",
		"  Aoko's stand-up routine was far ahead of its time.",
		"  Soujuurou backed away from the window and begrudgingly left the sunroom,",
		"  feeling Alice's all-too-familiar inscrutable gaze upon his back.",
		"\"What's up, Alice-\"",
		"  Just as he opened his mouth to ask her what she wanted...",
		"\"Ow!\"",
		"  A blue comet crashed into his head.",
		"  It needed no explanation.",
		"  It could only be Robin, the mysterious bird that appeared frequently in the mansion.",
		"  Chirp, chirp, chirp! It shrilled accusingly.",
		"  The truth was...",
		"  The tiny aggressor that assaulted him just now was the greatest of the mansion's seven wonders.",
		"  Soujuurou encountered all sorts of people along his route to work.",
		"  Still new to city life, he found the crowds of people outside the station utterly fascinating. In fact, they were the highlight of his commute.",
		"  No two people wore exactly the same clothes or walked in the same fashion.",
		"  With so many people, you would think they would all melt into an indistinguishable huddle, but each person he saw was different and unique.",
		"  Soujuurou was excited as a child as he looked out at the bustling, diverse streets of the city.",
		"\"...Stop it.\"",
		"  Closing his eyes in shame, he sighed.",
		"  He was upset with himself for behaving like a bumbling tourist from the countryside.",
		"\"Hey, you'll get in people's way spacing out in front of the crosswalk like that. Daydream somewhere else.\"",
		"  A stern and familiar voice behind him snapped him out of his navel-gazing.",
		"\"Let me guess. On your way to The Mad Bear?",
		"  My shift at the convenience store that starts at five. You?\"",
		"\"Same. Five o'clock start. Were you on your way somewhere else?\"",
		"\"I just stopped by a bookstore. I'm out of stuff to read, so I thought I'd look for something new.\"",
		"\"I see. I guess we both have some time to spare.\"",
		"  The girl who greeted him was Kojika Kumari, a work friend who was also in the same year at Misaki High.",
		"  Though, it would have been more accurate to say she was looking for a pretext to fight him rather than greet him.",
		"  To Soujuurou, Kumari had been the first person in the city he could look up to.",
		"  They'd met at his first job,",
		"  where she insisted he wasn't cut out to work the register after many mistakes, and convinced him to quit working at convenience stores altogether.",
		"In the end, she introduced him to his current job at the Chinese restaurant, The Mad Bear, a much better fit for Soujuurou.",
		"\"You look a little worse for wear, Shizuki. Why the long face? I've never seen you so pouty.",
		"  Usually, standing up straight is the one thing you're good at.",
		"  Something on your mind? ...Wait, are you getting bullied by the older guys at The Mad Bear? You can tell me anything, you know.\"",
		"  Though her tone was stern, her eyes were earnest.",
		"  Having grown up in the city herself, she was irritated by virtually everything Soujuurou said and did.",
		"  Nevertheless, she still treated him like an equal.",
		"  Introducing him to his current job was just one example of her sincerity.",
		"\"No, nothing like that. It's just, something strange happened. Something really unusual...\"",
		"  Soujuurou could not find the words to explain his situation, but that did not stop him from trying.",
		"  There were no problems at The Mad Bear to speak of.",
		"  He liked it just as much as his other job at Uotatsu, the fishmongers in the shopping district.",
		"  In fact, his problem had nothing to do with work at all.",
		"  No, his problem was a certain blue bird that would not stop pecking at him recently.",
		"\"You're getting pecked? By a bird? ...Wow. And here I was thinking the world had ended.",
		"  ...It is pretty unusual for a bird to be blue, I guess.\"",
		"\"And that's not the only thing unusual about it.\"",
		"  He stopped, unsure of how to proceed.",
		"  Words alone were not enough to convey the bird's plump body or the sound of its chirping.",
		"\"Hmm. There is a beautifully colored bird called the mountain bluebird, but they're not native to Japan.",
		"  Maybe it's a blue swallow?\"",
		"\"No, it's more round than a swallow. I tried to look it up in a bird book and the closest thing I found was a robin.\"",
		"\"Yeah, but robins aren't blue.",
		"  ...You know those blue chicks they have at fairs in the city? Of course you don't, why would you? Just forget it.",
		"  Anyway, this robin-is it the only one?\"",
		"\"Yeah, there's only one. It doesn't seem to have a mate.\"",
		"\"Hmm. Well, if it's the only one of its kind, then I feel kinda sorry for it.",
		"  Imagine being the last one of your kind since the day you're born. Talk about lonely!",
		"  I have no idea what species it could be. Maybe you should try being nice to it next time. It might bring you something special, like when you find a ten yen coin in a vending machine!\"",
		"  Her words were perfectly kind, but he could hardly sympathize with the creature after all the painful pecking to which it had subjected him.",
		"  He wouldn't have called the bird lonely, either.",
		"\"If one little bird is all that's bothering you, you're lucky.",
		"  The pecking part is weird for sure, especially in a city like this, but it could be way worse. Imagine getting attacked by an army of crows that swarm around the dumpsters!\"",
		"\"Right. Actually, there was something else bothering me, too.\"",
		"  Her example had reminded him of the mystery of the disappearing birds at the mansion.",
		"  A stranger than strange event.",
		"\"See that hill? I actually live on it.",
		"  I see lots of starlings around there, but for some reason they never come down to town.\"",
		"\"Well, duh, you never see birds in town. But on a mountain like that there are bound to be wild animals!",
		"  Why would you move way out there, anyway? I mean, I heard you moved out of your old apartment, but isn't it a pain getting to school? What are you doing out there in the boonies?\"",
		"\"Things just worked out that way. And the commute isn't hard. If anything is painful, it's what happens inside that place.\"",
		"\"Huh?\"",
		"  It took thirty minutes to reach town on foot.",
		"  The forty minutes to the nearest convenience store would be the real kicker for most people, but for Soujuurou it was no inconvenience.",
		"  The real problem was the dark forces beyond human understanding that lurked within the grounds.",
		"\"Sorry, I didn't mean to bring all my complaints to you.",
		"  I'm curious about how you said there aren't many birds in town, though. Why is that?\"",
		"\"Simple. They failed to adapt to the environment.",
		"  I didn't know you were so interested in birds. Are you an animal lover or something?\"",
		"\"I guess I do like animals more than I dislike them.\"",
		"\"Really? I can't stand them. I'm surprised you didn't pick up on it sooner.\"",
		"  Her statement could hardly be more self-contradictory.",
		"  Minutes after telling him to be nice to a bird that attacked him, she was now claiming she did not even like animals.",
		"\"Well, even if you can't stand animals, I'd still like to hear what you know about birds.\"",
		"\"Can't take a hint, huh.",
		"  Fine. I need to kill some time until work starts anyway.",
		"  So, like I was saying, survival is all about being able to adapt to your environment.\"",
		"\"Misaki's pretty big now, but it wasn't always like this.",
		"  Half of it used to be woodland, which was closer to the type of environment the poor things were used to living in.\"",
		"  The way Kumari addressed them was of note.",
		"  Whether she liked them or not, she seemed to at least have some respect for them.",
		"\"Nature ended up with the short straw as the city modernized. Humans always change their surroundings to suit their needs, after all.",
		"  Diverting streams to get rid of mosquitoes, covering everything in town with concrete... It made the area unlivable for the birds.",
		"  Without enough bugs or trees they had no choice but to flee. Chased out of their home they moved from the forest to the mountains.",
		"  A convenient urban center for humans isn't the kind of place that can support a colony of birds.\"",
		"\"And that's all it took to get rid of birds in the city?",
		"  Just like that, and we never see them again?\"",
		"\"It's not *that* extreme. I mean, come on, you just said you see starlings.",
		"  It's all relative. There are so many humans in town, the number of birds seems small in comparison. It feels special just to spot one here or there.\"",
		"\"That's true. So they all just left town and moved to the mountains...\"",
		"  Humans might not be able to see them in day-to-day life, but they were alive and well nonetheless.",
		"  Their habitat and lifestyle changed with the times, but they never truly disappeared.",
		"  Soujuurou's sense of relief was sharply disrupted by a serious look from Kumari.",
		"\"But the birds aren't safe in the mountains.",
		"  There's still overfishing by humans and conflict between the birds and their new ecosystem. With everything going on I doubt they'll last very long. Even a century might be optimistic.",
		"  Just look at what happened to passenger pigeons. Once humans noticed what they'd done to them, it was already too late. That's how it always is.\"",
		"\"...What are passenger pigeons?\"",
		"\"Oh, they were large, beautiful birds, about forty centimeters from head to tail.",
		"  The males were a deep blue, with vivid red on their breast. The cutest part was their orange eyes-like something out of a book! And they could fly up to a hundred kilometers per hour over great distances.\"",
		"  Her voice had a certain tenderness to it.",
		"  She was daydreaming about birds she had never even seen in the flesh.",
		"\"They were a type of pigeon native to North America, so they used to fly north in spring and then back south in winter until it got warm again.",
		"  But that was over a century ago.",
		"  They used to be the most common higher animal on Earth.",
		"  There were five billion of them in total-that's more passenger pigeons than humans! Pretty amazing, right?\"",
		"\"Wow. I never thought about an animal being more common than humans.\"",
		"\"Yeah, I know. But now they're all extinct, thanks to those same humans.",
		"  Settlers from Europe who went to the Americas in the sixteenth century mentioned flocks of passenger pigeons so vast they covered the entire sky.",
		"  Those are the oldest written references to them that we have.\"",
		"\"Books are the only way to know anything about them these days.",
		"  It's hard to imagine so many birds that they block out the sun, cover whole forests, and rain down droppings like snow. It sounds like something out of a dream, doesn't it?",
		"  But for people back then it was more like a nightmare.",
		"  Sure, each individual bird was beautiful, but together they amounted to a violent force of nature.\"",
		"\"They were downright demonic with the power to destroy forests and threaten everyone.",
		"  Their nesting grounds were up to ten kilometers wide, and just one colony could have fifty thousand birds in it, so you can imagine how loud it got.",
		"  A flock of birds so big it could instantly transform the landscape and cover the whole land with its cries... I can see why the settlers were scared at first.\"",
		"\"Fifty thousand birds, all in one spot...\"",
		"  Soujuurou trailed off as he attempted to count the number with his digits.",
		"  He could barely count the number of people in the crowd outside the station. This would be far beyond his capacity.",
		"\"But if there were so many of them, how could humans wipe them out?\"",
		"\"Good question. No one back then thought it was possible, either.",
		"  But it's simple when you realize that passenger pigeons were both a threat and a cheap commodity.\"",
		"\"All the flying was what made the meat of migratory birds so delicious to humans.",
		"  And all you had to do was point your gun in the air. Bang! And there's dinner. What would you do in their shoes?",
		"  This might sound heartless, but the passenger pigeons were a species that could easily be converted into cold, hard cash.\"",
		"\"Naturally, the hunting went on and on.",
		"  People would pluck their feathers, stick them in a barrel with salt, and ship them out.\"",
		"\"It wasn't hunting after a point, just consuming a resource. It didn't feel like work or labor to the people doing it.",
		"  In those days you could get a whole passenger pigeon for one cent. That's roughly equal to one yen.",
		"  Can you believe it?",
		"  The smallest denomination of currency in society was enough to purchase an entire life.\"",
		"  Kumari spoke as if reciting from a textbook.",
		"  Her voice nevertheless had a certain darkness to it-was it pity for the slain birds, or disgust for her fellow man?",
		"  Either way, the passenger pigeons' fate was a cruel joke carried out by humanity. Typical, some might say.",
		"  Poor Soujuurou had yet to comprehend just how typical that side of humanity was.",
		"\"And that was only the beginning. The real damage began in the nineteenth century.",
		"  Passenger pigeon hunting became more popular than ever before.",
		"  Remember learning about the Gold Rush, and the American Civil War? America was expanding really fast back then.",
		"  Immigrants kept flooding in from Europe, and by 1870 there were forty million people living in America. Passenger pigeons were the perfect thing for their purses and stomachs.\"",
		"\"But the worst part is how scheming people were.",
		"  They competed to find the fastest, most efficient way to catch as many passenger pigeons as possible.",
		"  One thing they used to do is blind one pigeon and then use it as a lure for the group, sometimes catching ten thousand in a single day. Yet no one had a single qualm about what they were doing.",
		"  Any sane person could see that the balance between breeding and hunting was clearly out of whack.\"",
		"  She was doing everything she could to speak in calm, measured tones.",
		"  Soujuurou, meanwhile, was completely enraptured by her words.",
		"  Having been raised in the mountains it was by no means a happy story for him, but right now he was more interested in knowing why it ever happened in the first place.",
		"\"Something seems off about that. If their numbers were decreasing so fast the passenger pigeons should've tried harder to avoid humans.\"",
		"\"That's where they were unlucky.",
		"  They had really low fertility rates and no means of protecting themselves. All they knew to do was live together in groups. That was their only form of self-defense.\"",
		"\"Passenger pigeons managed to build an empire of five billion only because they lacked natural predators. Indigenous people didn't hunt them either, apparently.",
		"  It was the settlers who wrecked the local ecosystem.",
		"  No one ever imagined in their wildest dreams that so many birds could just go extinct.",
		"  The passenger pigeons couldn't have been prepared for a predator showing up centuries later out of the blue from across the ocean.\"",
		"\"Finally, in 1896 humans began to realize what their crazed enthusiasm had brought about.",
		"  A quarter of a million passenger pigeons...",
		"  That's how many they estimated were still left. But it was too late. The government tried passing laws to protect them, but human habits are hard to break.\"",
		"\"Or maybe hunters just thought that with two hundred and fifty thousand passenger pigeons still left,",
		"  taking one or two thousand wouldn't be a big deal in the greater scheme of things.\"",
		"\"Hunters started using the latest technological breakthrough, the telegraph, to keep track of where the passenger pigeons were. Soon they had shot down two hundred thousand, and injured forty thousand more.",
		"  That left only five thousand passenger pigeons in the world. And at that point they could no longer survive in the wild.\"",
		"  Soujuurou's face sunk into a scowl.",
		"No longer able to survive in the wild...",
		"  He knew all too well what that phrase meant.",
		"  No wild animal can last long on its own.",
		"  No animal can survive without a sufficiently large population of their fellow kind and sufficient feeding grounds to support the group.",
		"  Strength in their massive numbers was all the passenger pigeons ever had, and so once that was gone they were as good as extinct.",
		"\"What happened to them in the end, though?\"",
		"\"Eventually there were only *three* passenger pigeons left.",
		"  Two males and one female were kept in captivity at the Cincinnati Zoo, but within the year both the males had died.",
		"  Then only the female was left.",
		"  At that moment when the other two died, she became the single loneliest creature on earth.\"",
		"\"Her name was Martha.",
		"  The last of her species that had once soared over North America, she would never fly free again, trapped forever in her cage.",
		"  At the age of twenty nine she finally passed.",
		"  It happened at one o'clock on September 1st, 1914.",
		"  The only case in all of Earth history where we know the exact moment a species went extinct.\"",
		"  The story of five billion deaths had finally come to an end.",
		"  The birds had been swallowed up by the machinations of human civilization.",
		"  Kumari had intended to show her sympathy for the lost species, but the emotional impact had clearly been all but lost on Soujuurou.",
		"\"Huh. I tried to make it sound all poetic and tragic, but I guess I failed.",
		"Aren't you angry, as someone raised around nature in the mountains?\"",
		"\"Oh... It was definitely an amazing story.",
		"  But it doesn't make sense. Why would humans keep passenger pigeons in captivity after working so hard to kill them?\"",
		"  Kumari stared blankly at him, eyebrows raised high.",
		"  What he likely meant to ask was why humans would protect the last of a species",
		"they themselves had hunted into extinction.",
		"  Kumari could hardly be blamed for her bewilderment.",
		"  Having been raised in the city she failed to recognize the danger inherent in his cluelessness.",
		"  He felt neither anger toward humans",
		"  for their base selfishness, nor sympathy for the birds",
		"  who remained in their natural habitat even at the cost of their lives.",
		"  His upbringing had not provided him with the necessary sense of self-righteousness to produce feelings in either direction.",
		"\"You don't get it, do you?",
		"  My point was that no matter how strong and beautiful animals might look, they don't stand a chance outside of their natural habitat.",
		"  Think about it, Shizuki.",
		"  That bird you're complaining about might be the very last of its kind.\"",
		"  And with that, their idle conversation came to an end.",
		"  It was nearly time for their shifts to begin, and Soujuurou was the first to head off.",
		"\"What was I even thinking? It's not like me to rant like that.\"",
		"  Kumari remained in the park after Soujuurou left.",
		"  Martha. The last of her species...",
		"  She had not been referring to the blue bird when she mentioned Martha, but...",
		"\"No, stop it. Thinking something is special just because it's rare is dumb.\"",
		"  She rubbed the back of her head, apparently angry at herself for getting involved in something that was none of her business.",
		"  She and Soujuurou were not even in the same class at school; he was a total stranger as far as she was concerned.",
		"  The more something bothered her, the more she felt compelled to investigate it. It was a personal quirk of hers and the only reason she had gotten so worked up about the passenger pigeons.",
		"  Kumari's well-groomed brow furrowed.",
		"  She had only spoken to Soujuurou to make sure he was doing okay at The Mad Bear. Or maybe, it was that she had been strangely drawn to him.",
		"  The more they spoke the more she felt drawn to him.",
		"\"At first glance he looks like the last guy you would rely on, but when you get to talking to him you realize he's really got it together.\"",
		"  Amidst her muttered complaints she recalled their conversation upon parting.",
		"\"So, gotten used to everything yet?\"",
		"  to which he had given a weak shake of his head.",
		"\"Not at all. There are so many things to keep track of.\"",
		"  He was trying his best to keep up with the overwhelming amount of new information every day.",
		"  However, despite his apparent naivety and frailty, he was in fact trying to learn everything he could about his new surroundings.",
		"  But at the same, there was no reason it needed to be so overwhelming in the first place.",
		"  It was only due to his own naively subordinate frame of mind that he felt compelled to memorize each and every detail.",
		"\"I wonder...I don't think I'm exactly being subordinate.",
		"  The fact is I'm still just figuring out what's right and wrong.\"",
		"  He awkwardly claimed.",
		"\"Right. But, maybe... Just maybe...\"",
		"  Kumari stopped herself mid-train of thought, deciding to instead wave goodbye and take her leave.",
		"  She sighed aloud every time she replayed the scene in her head.",
		"  Work at the convenience store started in five minutes.",
		"  She gave herself a light slap on the face in an effort to forget their conversation.",
		"  She reminded herself that she had neither the energy to worry about other people's problems nor the obligation to do so.",
		"  She had her own concerns-saving up enough money for college, for example.",
		"  Fighting against her parents' opposition every night was draining enough. There was no room for burdening herself with other students' issues.",
		"\"Right. But, maybe... Just maybe...\"",
		"  It was not like her to get so tongue-tied, she thought to herself under a strained smile.",
		"\"I should have made my point more clearly.",
		"  I should have flat-out asked him if he cares at all about human morality.\"",
		"  He really did annoy her.",
		"  Now in a thoroughly bad mood, she left the park in a huff.",
		"  When Soujuurou entered the drawing room after work with a gift of sardines for his roommates, he came face to face with Alice sitting on the sofa.",
		"\"Oh, err... Hi, Alice.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  The sense of familiarity to be able to say \"I'm home\" when entering the mansion still eluded Soujuurou.",
		"  He headed straight to the kitchen to fill a bucket with water to keep the sardines fresh,",
		" but the icy stare on his back sent him anxiously to the refrigerator instead.",
		"(Buckets are not allowed in the kitchen, remember?)",
		"  Calmly accepting the change in plans, he shoved the sardines into the fridge and peeked back into the drawing room.",
		"\"Alice, have you seen Aozaki?\"",
		"\"Well, either she's in her room or she's gone out somewhere.\"",
		"  Her reply was curt.",
		"  He nodded and got to work cleaning the kitchen.",
		"  There was nothing in particular he wanted to say to her and also sensed that it would not be a good idea to start up a conversation needlessly.",
		"  So he tidied up the sink area, washed the cutting board, wiped down the knives, and put away the cutlery so they could be easily found.",
		"  Her black eyes monitored every action in his streamlined work flow,",
		"  a rhythm that even the most seasoned housekeeper would be envious of.",
		"  He would surely notice her gaze before too long.",
		"  He bent over to store a large pot under the sink when it happened.",
		"  As he began to stand back up he locked eyes with Alice, and then...",
		"\"MAYDAY! MAYDAY!",
		"  Sling yer hook, boy!\"",
		"\"Owww!\"",
		"  Before he could make another move",
		"he felt something slam into the back of his head―a bright shock of blue.",
		"  He knew what it was without looking.",
		"  It could only be the mansion's blue robin.",
		"\"Why does that thing have to start messing with me as soon as I get home?\"",
		"  Soujuurou muttered under his breath.",
		"  It was a rare situation that made Soujuurou feel like complaining.",
		"\"Pull up a chair, boy!\"",
		"  The robin chirped in its shrill tone.",
		"  You see...",
		"  This little creature that loved to attack Soujuurou so, was the greatest of the mansion's many wonders.",
		"  And with good reason.",
		"\"Are you havin' a bird bath, mate? You think you're better than me, ey? And what the bloody hell is chicken stew supposed to mean anyway? You got somefink against a Richard the Third?\"",
		"  Like so.",
		"  Soujuurou had an inkling of what the bird was getting at.",
		"  For someone raised in the mountains this was an utter nightmare.",
		"  Animals were not supposed to be able to talk.",
		"  Then again, having lived in the mountains for over a decade he did sometimes feel like he could understand what birds were trying to say. He knew it was just his imagination, but sometimes he thought they even saw him as a friend.",
		"  That was not the case with this bird.",
		"  Soujuurou had a realist's attitude toward wild animals as a result of being so familiar with them, in contrast to the ever mysterious humans who lived in the city.",
		"\"It's... really talking to me.\"",
		"  As much as he wanted to deny the reality he was facing, he could not help but recall Kumari's story.",
		"  She had said to try and be nice to the bird the next time he saw it.",
		"  According to her, any rare or one-of-a-kind creature must accordingly feel very lonely.",
		"\"I said sit your pipe and drum down! You hearin' me all right, mate?",
		"  Hang on, there's no chair in 'ere! All right, just stand. I mean, I've stood up with you enough for the both of us!",
		"  Get it? Pretty clever, if I say so myself!\"",
		"  The bird perched itself on the telephone receiver, seemingly worn out from all the flapping.",
		"  Soujuurou was dumbfounded.",
		"  Listening in silence to the bird's chatter was his way of expressing his denial.",
		"\"I'm pretty old, ya know, on account of me long career as a Ploy.",
		"I've served Miss Alice from when the Goddess Mum was around. Don't ask why I'm blue.",
		"My best skills are playin' the detective and the victim. But my detective side always dies first so no one can ever figure out who killed me!\"",
		"\"Wait, you're a Ploy? I've heard that word before. What does it mean again?\"",
		"\"Say what? Is you askin' what I is?",
		"  I don't know what to feel right now―sexy or terrified!\"",
		"  Thusly, the conversation began between the two most powerless residents of the Kuonji Estate.",
		"  Humankind and birdkind, able to",
		"  understand one another after all.",
		"  Soujuurou was tired of letting the bird get to him, fully aware that ignoring it took more energy than it was worth.",
		"  Filled with a sense of resignation, by the time he finally did make an attempt to interject, both parties' guards were firmly down.",
		"  Soujuurou was focused on how rare the bird was,",
		"  while Robin was focused on his showdown with his rival that was to be eliminated at all costs.",
		"\"Don't get your knickers in a twist. Let's talk about something more important, like my beloved Miss Alice! The Angel Mum herself!\"",
		"\"Wait. She's an angel?\"",
		"  It was an impressive sign of progress that he did not need to ask what an \"angel\" was.",
		"\"Aye bruv, an angel! The way she's above the hustle and bustle of the masses, the way she doesn't give me the time of day... Absolutely angelic, I tell ya!",
		"  She's holy and sacred she is, but she's also cruel and inhuman. Pretty fittin' for an angel, don't you think?",
		"  Honestly, sometimes I think Goddess Mum didn't do the best job raisin' Angel Mum.\"",
		"\"Okay... So Alice has a mom?",
		"  I thought maybe she didn't have any family at all.\"",
		"\"Oh yes, she has one all right, but it's a sob story, innit? All the birds in England cried out that day! Her mum was even more smashing than Alice. Gots photos later if you like. Fer only sixpence! How 'bout it, lad?\"",
		"\"Uh, no thanks. I wouldn't want to do that without her permission.\"",
		"  Soujuurou said earnestly as he tilted his head.",
		"  The reason for his unease was also due to the fact that he had grown more interested in Alice than before.",
		"  Despite his detached and passive attitude, he was still a young man like any other, after all.",
		"\"And right you'd be, lad.",
		"  You know, you make sum sense for a feral human. You're right, I shouldn't go blabbin' about people's pasts.",
		"  But maybe you'd 'ike to hear about her childhood! How 'bout it, lad? I'd love to lay bare some of her deepest, darkest secrets for ya. It'd make me feel like a heap 'o dosh!\"",
		"\"Err... I just said I don't want to-\"",
		"\"Lighten up, lad. I won't tell Alice about our little rabbit and pork.",
		"Let me start with the day we first met. Despite 'er looks she didn't have so much as a single friend in the world, ya see. I was the only one that mother 'o pearl had to talk to.",
		"  Imagine playin' that game where you bounce a ball against a wall by your lonesome. It was just like that. Fourteen years of memories with her, I have. So lemme start at the beginning...\"",
		"\"I just said-\"",
		"\"Here we go!",
		"  Buckle in 'cause this is gonna get good!\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"  This bird was trouble.",
		"  The word \"bird-brained\" had taken on a whole new meaning to Soujuurou.",
		"  If he were stuck here listening any longer, he had the feeling he might hear something he would not be able to unhear.",
		"\"Sorry, but I should really get going.\"",
		"  With a wave of his hand he attempted to flee to the attic above the second floor.",
		"\"Now wait just one minute, boy! You're about to miss the best part! Who do you think you are, Scarlet O'Hara? You think you're the most important character in this war?!",
		"  You're not foolin' me, that's for sure. What's a saucepan and lid like you gettin' all Angel Mum's attention? Why, you're all she looks at. I can't stand it! So you'd better tell me your secret! I'm serious, and you ne'er wanna see me get serious!\"",
		"\"What?\"",
		"  Halfway up the stairs already, Soujuurou quickly retraced his steps.",
		"\"What did you just say?\"",
		"\"That whenever Angel Mum has a moment to spare, she starts watchin' you like a hawk, that's what!",
		"  And now I remember why I wanted to talk to you! I wanted to make sure you don't go gettin' any big ideas just 'cause she's looking you over with that burning look in her mince pies!",
		"  I've already saved you more times than you know, Mr. Sono-G.",
		"  If it wasn't for Miss Alice's orders you'd be stuck in some old mirror, you know. What's really going on? Is this that crazy rubber and glove that you humans get all Moby Dick over?\"",
		"\"...You're saying she saved me? Alice? Saved me?\"",
		"\"Yeah, well, she's also the one tryin' to kill you, but come off it!",
		"  Here's what she told me. She said to save you if you ever were about to get lost in the mirror or got too close to somefin dangerous... but don't go gettin' no big 'ead, you hear me? It's not like anyone cares what happens to yo-",
		"GYARGH!\"",
		"  It happened in a flash.",
		"  With a swift, unhesitating strike of her hand, Alice squashed the bird right then and there as it sat on the telephone receiver stand in the foyer.",
		"  Her pressed palm continued to pin it down.",
		"  The bird's crushed form resembled a bright rubber ball, like what a child might play with.",
		"\"Hey! What's the big idea, Miss Alice!",
		"  You're killin' me! I can feel all the blood in my body gushing out me beak!\"",
		"  The bird raised a mighty uproar.",
		"\"...",
		"...Ignore everything the bird says.\"",
		"  Alice returned to the drawing room, taking the bird with her.",
		"  Her dark silhouette cloaked in shadow was the complete opposite of the gaudy little bird.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  Soujuurou folded his arms as he stood alone, no less confused than before, and whispered,",
		"\"Things get stranger by the day around here,\"",
		"  up at the night sky visible through the skylight.",
		"  Misaki High School's winter vacation began in mid-December."
