		"　もしかしたら朝なんて無いんじゃないかと思うぐらい、どこもかしこも目が覚めている。",
		"「…………」",
		"　まだ聞き慣れない、岩を<転|ころ>がすような<悲鳴|ひめい>で目を覚ました。",
		"　怪音の正体は自動二輪車のエンジン音で、どうやらおとなりの<吉田|よしだ>さんが出勤したらしい。",
		"　朝が<曖昧|あいまい>なこの街は、夜だって曖昧だ。",
		"　機械仕掛けというのは眠らない事と同義なのだろう。",
		"「信じられない……まだ陽も昇ってないのに……吉田さんはどこに行くのか……」",
		"　のっそり床から身を起こす。",
		"　これまでの習慣であたりを徘徊しそうになって、その必要はないと気が付き、流し場に向かう。",
		"　コップに<二口|ふたくち>分の水を<汲|く>んで、ゆっくりと喉に通した。",
		"　ちょっと前までは井戸水を汲んでいた草十郎にとって、この便利さは喜ばしい。",
		"　喜ばしい、と思うことが正しい。",
		"　文明とは複雑化と最適化を突き詰めるもので、",

		"　<手前|テメエ>はともかく前者の方から慣れるべきだ、とも彼は言った。",
		"　草十郎の父の遠縁である恒河氏は、わりと、ほとんど他人に近い草十郎をここまで世話してくれた恩人である。",

		"　不安だらけだったひとり暮らしも、やってみればなんとかなるものだ。",
		"　言葉が通じるんだから当たり前と言えば当たり前だし、なにより恒河氏の言うとおり、生活面だけなら都会の<あり方|ルール>はがっしりと筋が通っている。",

		"　忠告サンキュー。それで、相談ごと？　なに、もしかして金？」",
		"「そうなんだ。とりあえずお金は大事で、たくさんあるに越したことはないって痛感した。なんで、出来ればもうちょっと働きたい」",
		"「うぇ、マジぃ？　マシーンみたいに皿洗いをこなしながら夢のないコト言わないでほしいなあ。",
		"　世の中金じゃねえって言ったばかりじゃんか。やっぱラブじゃんか。ところで水冷たくないですかね？　冬場の皿洗いって割合わねえコトこの上ねえよな？」",

		"　未成年でも働かせてくれるアバウトな中華飯店の店長は、たとえ赤ん坊の頃から顔見知り……お隣さんの息子さん……であろうと鉄拳を振るう、たくましい人物だった。",
		"　こういうのをスパルタと言うんだな、と草十郎は感心する。",
		"「ほら怒られた。任された事はきちんとやらないと」",
		"「けっ、優等生め。こっちは何かと反抗したい年頃だっつの。",
		"　まあいいや。話は変わるんだけどよ。",
		"　静希、夜に出歩くタイプ？　それかチャリンコで出ばる趣味？　いやまぁ、どっちかでいいんだけど」",
		"「……？　バイトの帰りはほとんど夜になるけど、そういう話じゃないんだよな。夜の散歩も遠出も趣味じゃないけど、それが？」",
		"「いや、なにさ。静希、引っ越してきたばかりだっていうからよ。オレらが言うのもなんだけど、<三咲町|うち>、ちょい治安が悪いっての？　ガラが悪いワケじゃねえんだけどな。",
		"　年間十人ぐらい通り魔事件っての？　そういうの、起きてっから」",
		"「……とおりまって、なんだ？」",
		"「そっからかよ！",
		"　……なんだ、ほら！　カバン強盗……でもないか。",
		"<辻斬|つじぎ>りってのが近いのか。住宅街とか、まだ森が残ってる方によく出やがるんだよ、そういうおかしいのが。",
		"　なんで、あんまり夜遅くは出歩くなよな。三咲丘の公園とか、有名な怪奇スポットだから。",
		"　通り魔の犯人は口裂け女だったって話、知らねえか？」",
		"「ごめん、まずその口裂け女ってのが分からない」",
		"「怪談だよ。口が耳まで裂けてるってヤツ。",
		"　今じゃさすがに時代遅れだけどよ」",
		"「えーとなんだっけ、深夜の道にな、コート姿の女が待ち伏せていて『わたしきれい？』とか聞いてくるんだよ。",
		"　で、キレイって言ってもイマイチって言っても家まで追っかけられて殺されるの。",
		"女の情念はおっかねえっつうか、アメコミの怪人っぽいっつうか」",
		"「……いや、それ本気で怖くないか？",
		"　家まであがってくるのか、その女の人？」",
		"「窓から入ってくるらしいぜ。",
		"　ガサガサと、こう、ゴキブリみた―――",
		"ぎゃっ！？」",
		"「っのクソガキが、厨房でその四文字は禁止だってんだろ、殺すぞ！」",
		"　そうして木乃美の後頭部に炸裂する、店長のフライパン／縦攻撃。",
		"　なるほど、町は危険であふれている、と草十郎は再び感心した。",
		"「殺す殺すってバカじゃねえの!?",
		"　フツーそっちの方が禁止用語じゃねえの!?　ここレストランなんだしさ！　いや、あんまうまくねーけど！」",
		"「木乃美、頭、大丈夫か？」",
		"「え？　あ、ん、心配無用。オレ、なんでか頑丈さには定評があるから。特に頭部について。",
		"　ともかく、そういうワケなんで夜の暗がりは気をつけるぞなもし。静希、見るからにカモそうな顔してるし」",
		"「ありがとう。",
		"　ところで、年間十人というのは多い方なのか？」",
		"「知んねぇよ。少なくはないだろうけど、多い方でもないんじゃねえか？",
		"　ま、<三|う><咲|ち>の通り魔事件が他に比べて厄介なのは、まだ犯人が見つかってないってコトだからネ！」",
		"　はははは、と陽気に笑う。",
		"　そうやって不吉な話を笑い話に切り替える木乃美の高度な意図は、もちろん草十郎には伝わっていない。",
		"　親切な忠告も<糠|ぬか>に<釘|くぎ>。",
		"　そっか、ここは笑うところなのか、とまたも真剣に感心する草十郎なのだった。",
		"　その帰り道。",
		"　前にも後ろにも人のいない、電灯だけが照らす暗い住宅地で、草十郎は唐突に、",
		"「……？」",
		"　何か、ありえない物音に振り返った。",
		"「―――あいた！？」",
		"　脳天に刺さる衝撃と、ぽとん、と足下に落ちる音。",
		"　ついてない、と<眉|まゆ>を<曇|くも>らせる。",
		"　電柱にぶつかって墜ちてきた小鳥に、歩いていた自分がぶつかってしまったらしい。",
		"　ムクドリは路面で<毛繕|けづくろ>いをした後、あわただしく飛んでいった。",
		"　鳥が墜ちてくるコトも、",
		"　その後、慌てるように飛び去っていくコトも、",
		"　彼の今までの生活、今までの常識にはなかった事だ。",
		"　町の人間なら『墜ちてきた鳥に当たる』なんて不運、奇遇に、不吉なものを感じるのだろうが、草十郎はなるほど、とうなずいて帰路についた。",
		"　―――なに。",
		"　自分にとっては初めての経験だったが、都会ではよくある事に違いない。"

		"  Morning in the city moved incredibly fast.",
		"  It made one wonder if it was even a morning at all, with people so bright eyed and bushy tailed.",
		"\"...\"",
		"  The unfamiliar roar that awoke him reminded him of a rockslide.",
		"  The identity of the monstrous sound was the engine of a motorcycle. Mr. Yoshida, his neighbor, was leaving for work.",
		"  It was hard to determine when night ended and morning began here.",
		"  The town's urbanization was synonymous with insomnia.",
		"\"Already? It's barely sun-up yet... Where could Mr. Yoshida be going so early?\"",
		"  He sluggishly lifted himself off the floor.",
		"  He caught himself starting to survey his surroundings out of habit before deciding better of it, and made his way to the washroom.",
		"  There, he poured himself a cup of water and slowly gulped it down.",
		"  Having been relegated to well water until recently, he found the convenience pleasing.",
		"  'Pleased' was definitely the word that best described how he felt.",
		"  Civilization is about erasing inconveniences through optimization.",
		"  The reduction of labor in our daily lives.",
		"  Mr. Koga had taught him that while the essentials were easier than ever to get our hands on, life itself was growing more and more complex.",
		"  So too was it his duty to adjust to his new reality.",
		"  As a distant relative of Soujuurou's father, Mr. Koga had taken Soujuurou in, even though the boy had been little more than a stranger in his life till that point.",
		"  Mr. Koga had helped him get registered at school and find an apartment to lease.",
		"  Though he had insisted that Soujuurou handle his residence card and register his change of address by himself.",
		"  This series of procedures proved exceedingly difficult for Soujuurou, but knowing that this was a part of his new city life, he did his best to complete them diligently.",
		"(While they may have a reputation for being a stickler for the rules, city offices aren't all that bad.)",
		"  It was the first thing Soujuurou learned after beginning his life in the city.",
		"  Two weeks had elapsed since he left the countryside.",
		"  As uneasy as living alone made him feel, he felt he could make it work.",
		"  It was not as if the people here spoke another language, and Mr. Koga was absolutely right about how practical the rules of the city were.",
		"  Soujuurou continued down the hard, but surprisingly walkable path.",
		"  Before work, he jogged in the park to pass the time.",
		"  Even exercise like this offered lessons for Soujuurou to learn.",
		"  Each passing person was a new face to look at.",
		"  The old man who greeted him,",
		"  the young worker with his eyes to the ground,",
		"  and the girl on the bench, surrounded by birds...",
		"  They were all unfamiliar sights to Soujuurou.",
		"  Unaccustomed to the city, he labored to understand its rules.",
		"  Whether they were complex or simple,",
		"  or completely meaningless.",
		"  Compared to mountain life, which only dealt with nature, city life left one with way too many options.",
		"  You could argue that such an environment was toxic for Soujuurou.",
		"  His life was a string of unsettling moments.",
		"  But amongst it all, there were rules that he sincerely admired.",
		"  For one, that the city revolved around various forms of profit and loss.",
		"  The fact that one only needed money to get bare essentials to survive the city was a comforting thought to Soujuurou.",
		"\"Hey, not everything's that simple.",
		"  Money is just a symbol. It's the other stuff that truly matters.",
		"  Money ain't that different from those free shoulder massage coupons people hand out, and it's not like the food you buy with a ten-thousand yen bill won't turn out bogus. Look, money can't buy you happiness, like, you know?\"",
		"\"Maybe.\"",
		"\"'Maybe'?! Are you for real? Man, I can't believe you right now.",
		"  One day you're happy to break your back working a full day for a measly four-thousand yen, the next you're elbow-deep in dirty dishes saying, 'It's all about the money.' What's your major malfunction?\"",
		"\"No, I think that the current system is kind of amazing. To be honest, I never realized how limited bartering can be.",
		"  Anyway, Kinomi-you're gonna drop that if you aren't careful.\"",
		"\"Huh? Crap! Ooh, damn! That was close! If I break any more, it'll be my head next!",
		"  Thanks for the save. So...what did you want to talk to me about? It's money, isn't it?\"",
		"\"Exactly. I learned my lesson the hard way, but now I know that it's better to have more money than less. That's why I'd like to work even more than I am now.\"",
		"\"Are you for real? You already wash dishes like a machine.",
		"  Didn't I just how money can't buy happiness? Love can, but... Back right up. Why's the water so cold? Say, we should probably get paid more for washing dishes in the winter, huh?\"",
		"\"It's cold all right, but nothing I can't handle.",
		"  Mountain water is so cold it hurts.\"",
		"\"Yo, I didn't mean it was ice water, you doofus. That hard head of yours can be real annoying, you know that?",
		"  For someone who couldn't even work a cash register four days ago, you sure got comfortable workin' for The Man. I guess money really is everything. The power of capitalism ain't nothing to mess with!\"",
		"\"Shut yer pie holes, part-timers! The door's right there if you wanna quit!",
		"  I don't have the cash to waste on deadbeats!\"",
		"  The complaints and chopsticks flew at them like a storm.",
		"  This mess of a Chinese restaurant manager was a stubborn man who was willing to let minors work for him and didn't shy from violence, even if it was directed at the son of a lifelong friend.",
		"  Soujuurou felt that this is what Sparta must have been like.",
		"\"Look, he's angry. We need to work harder.\"",
		"\"Wow, your nose get any browner yet? Me, I'm tryin' to make the most of my teens.",
		"  Whatever. Right, been meaning to ask...",
		"  Are you the type that likes to go out on late-night strolls or more of a bicycle kind of guy? Not that it really matters, but...\"",
		"\"Hm? It's always late when I go home after the restaurant, but that's not what you're asking, is it? I'm not really into walking when it's late out. Why do you ask?\"",
		"\"No reason. Like, you just moved here. Kinda weird question, but don't you think the town is dangerous? Not like people are bad or nothing.",
		"  But I mean, you know that we get ten attacks like outta a slasher flick every year, right? And since they started there's-\"",
		"\"What's a slasher?\"",
		"\"You don't know!?",
		"  It's like... when a thief snatches someone's purse... No, bad example.",
		"It's more like someone's killing to see if they can get away with it. Buncha dead people in the woods near the suburbs. Real gnarly.",
		"  That's why you shouldn't go out too late. The park in Misaki Hills is a hot spot for the weird stuff.",
		"  Haven't you heard about how they think the freak doing it is some chick with a sliced mouth?\"",
		"\"Nope. This is the first I've heard of a sliced-mouth woman.\"",
		"\"Like I said, slasher film shit. They say her mouth extends all the way to her ears.",
		"  It's a pretty old-school kinda urban legend, these days.\"",
		"\"How did it go again? There's a woman in a coat who asks 'Am I beautiful?' in the dead of night.",
		"  Even if you say she is, she'll follow you home and kill you.",
		"Intense chicks like that are a no-no. It's like, something you'd see in an American comic book.\"",
		"\"...That sounds really scary.",
		"  Does she actually follow you home?\"",
		"\"They say she crawls in through a window.",
		"  Squeezes her way in like a cockroa-",
		"AAAGH!\"",
		"\"I told you not to utter that word in this kitchen! I'm gonna kill you, you little turd!\"",
		"  The back of Kinomi's head exploded in pain with the impact of his boss's frying pan.",
		"  Soujuurou was reminded of just how dangerous this town could be.",
		"\"'I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna kill you!' Yeah right! I'd like to see him try!",
		"  And what kind of boss says that anyway?! This is a restaurant, ain't it!? Well, maybe calling it that is too much!\"",
		"\"Is your head okay, Kinomi?\"",
		"\"Huh? Ah, it's nothing. People tell me I'm real tough. Especially my head.",
		"  Anyway, avoid the dark, okay? You look like a sitting duck.\"",
		"\"Thanks.",
		"  By the way, is ten victims per year a lot?\"",
		"\"Don't know. It probably isn't a lot, but it totally ain't a few either.",
		"  The real scary shit is that they're still out there, somewhere, since they haven't been caught!",
		"  He laughed cheerfully.",
		"  Kinomi was probably trying to take the edge off of his story, but the noble intention of his laugh was completely lost on Soujuurou.",
		"  His friendly warning was equally futile.",
		"  Soujuurou was simply impressed that Kinomi was able to laugh it off.",
		"  On the way home...",
		"  Nobody ahead or behind. Soujuurou proceeded through the dimly lit street when suddenly...",
		"\"...?\"",
		"  He turned to face an... improbable sound.",
		"\"...Ouch!\"",
		"  Something stabbed him in the head, and fell to the floor.",
		"  He frowned.",
		"  A small bird had apparently flown into the telephone pole before landing on his head.",
		"  The starling cleaned itself off and flew away.",
		"  The falling of the bird",
		"  and its desperate escape thereafter",
		"  was unlike anything he had experienced in his life up to now.",
		"  Most of the townsfolk would have seen the incident as unlucky, ominous, or even sinister, but Soujuurou just nodded and went about his business.",
		"  You understand...",
		"  What might have been a first for him was surely an everyday occurrence for these city folk."
